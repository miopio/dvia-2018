## Visualization of time based on rhythms/cycles of the body

The human body is at its very core, a biological clock. From cell signaling, involuntary functions, to hormonal fluctuations, our bodies operate dependent on regular cycles.

These are the rhythms that I have selected, from shortest cycle length to longest:
* Neuronal Activity/Action Potential - ms
  * Steady rate AM/PM
* Heart Rate - min
  * avg day: 70/min
  * avg night: 55/min
* Respiratory Rate - min
  * avg day: 10/min
  * avg night: 8/min
* Sleep/REM Cycle - hours
  * only at night
  * avg 8 hours
  * 90 min cycles, avg 5 cycles
* Circadian Rhythm - daily
  * day/night
* Menstrual Cycle - monthly
  * estrogen level flow

Initially the idea was to visualize the traces of these various rhythms in 2D linear form. However, I thought it could be more "organic" if these linear traces could be manifested in abstract shapes that would change size in proportion to the amplitude of their original trace. The rates in which the shapes cycle through size will change depending on whether it is day or night, if these physiological functions do change in reality.

The final product would/should look like a living organism with all of the different components moving at their respective rates.

## Update
Instead of just objects changing shapes in a particular rate, I needed to create something that would spatially and visually communicate the passing of time in some way.After multiple iterations of visualizations that were too complicated (at least for a beginner coder like me), I decided to stick with the idea of filling in squares/shapes at the various rates of physiological rhythms I wanted to visualize:
 
 * Small variant: Heart rate, respiratory rate
 * Medium variant: Circadian rhythm, sleep cycle
 * Large variant: Menstrual cycle
 
 If we put all of these together into a single visualization, we get a clock based on physiological rhythms that can communicate time from minutes to months (or at least that is the hope).

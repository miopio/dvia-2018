## Process

INITIAL PRESENTATION - Sept. 5th, 2018
 As much as I'd like to do something elaborate, right now I'd just like to do my best to show that I have a basic understanding of using js to create with data. I did not sketch anything by hand. Instead I looked for reference materials that I either thought would be interesting to conceptualize (The Doomsday Clock) and/or would be something that I would have a chance of pulling off (clock created by artist Louie Rigano). This is my first attempt to create something with code.

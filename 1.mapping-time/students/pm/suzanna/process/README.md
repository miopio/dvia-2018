I worked on multiple hand sketches for visualizing time.  My idea was to keep the time concept of hour, minutes, and seconds; but, to visualize the time via polygraphs.  After my hand sketches, I went to Adobe Illustrator.  Using Illustrator I decided on the rotations of the polygraphs to represent changes in time---similar to the rotation of the planet.

## Process

###The idea of this project is inspired by the question "Does time exsit without space?". I spent a really long time thinking about how to inteprete this question in a more poetic way. "What does time and space have in common?", I asked myself.And then this idea came to my mind. The circular motion of a clock's hand resembles the movement of plannets. For me nothing else better represents space than an image of an unniverse with plannets floating around in orbits. And that's how I started imagine how the project should look like.
###This image of our solar system and the idea that different plannet has different orbital speed inspired me to set each plannet as a time variable and let it orbit around a sun in the center.

###For the style of the map, I got inspired by this project by Sarrah Kettell [An Interactive Solar System](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/138298)

###Now let's dive into how I set the variables for each time components
1. Small version
###Starting off with 3 components: second, minute and hour. The position (angle) of each plannet on its orbit, starting from the one closest to the sun, will change accordingly to each second, minute and hour. 
1. Medium version
###I added one more plannet on the outside to represent day. Therefore we now have secon, minute, hour and day components. I also adjusted everything to be smaller size to fit better in the screen.
1. Large version
###I added one more time component to the project which is year. I set the color of the sun as a variable, mapping it to each month. Each month, the sun will change color, from a green to a yellow. Even the change is subtle, it's still visible. Ideally, I would want the color to change to a random color everymonth, not just from a color range but I haven't figured out the codes yet so maybe that's a challenge for my next round of iteration.

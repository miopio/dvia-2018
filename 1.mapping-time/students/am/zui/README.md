#### Mapping Time Project Brainstorming

##### Some ideas
1. Noise level  
 - Need streaming data and API to extract real-time Data
 - No way to show time before the data collection
2. NYC TLC Taxi trips  
 - Familiar data set
 - Too large to be used for a simple clock as the number of trips throughout the time are concrete
3. Instagram images gained the most likes from the second

##### Back to p5.js
**A revolving clock**

#### Mapping Time

##### Variants
1. Small:
    * Each big circle represents a month in a year: The current month is the circle consists of small circles
    * Each small circle represents an hour in a day: the losing one represents the current hour
2. Medium:
    * am: red stroke;
      pm: blue stroke;
3. Large:
    * Season by background color;
    * am: right white semicircle, red stroke;
      pm: left white semicircle, blue stroke;
##### Final idea
*A revolving clock*
1. Idea came from the inspiration of the earth and the moon's revolution
2. From inside to outside, each rotating circle represents second, minute, hour, day, week, month, and season is represented by the quarter arcs
3. Inner circles are positioned on the outer circle

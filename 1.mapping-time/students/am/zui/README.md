 - No way to show time before the data collection
2. NYC TLC Taxi trips  
 - Familiar data set
 - Too large to be used for a simple clock as the number of trips throughout the time are concrete
3. Instagram images gained the most likes from the second

1. Idea came from the inspiration of the earth and the moon's revolution
2. From inside to outside, each rotating circle represents second, minute, hour, day, month, year/season (last one TBD)
3. Inner circles are positions on the outer circle

## Process

Description of the contents of this folder and the logic of your data â†’ retinal variables mapping.

#### Part 1 ####
#### Mapping Time Project Brainstorming

##### Some ideas
1. Noise level  
 - Need streaming data and API to extract real-time Data
 - No way to show time before the data collection
2. NYC TLC Taxi trips  
 - Familiar data set
 - Too large to be used for a simple clock as the number of trips throughout the time are concrete
3. Instagram images gained the most likes from the second


##### Back to p5.js
A revolving clock
1. Idea came from the inspiration of the earth and the moon's revolution
2. From inside to outside, each rotating circle represents second, minute, hour, day, month, year/season (last one TBD)
3. Inner circles are positions on the outer circle

#### Part 2 ####
#### Idea development
1. PLUS:
  - Add a century circle and colors for seasons
  - Click on higher circle to zoom in to the secondary level: yr -> mon -> d -> h -> min -> s
2. ORIGIN: no change
3. MINUS:
  - Circle of time: only a dot showing the time
  - Time circle revolves on the month circle (each position represents a day in the month)
  - Month circle revolves on the year circle (each position represents a month in the year)

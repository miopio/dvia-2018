## Process - Mapping-Time (Clock)

ORIGINAL Idea -- Mapping time through the color of the Sky -- set up camera and document 'grays' everyday at the same time -- and map the color to the clock --  really an overambitious idea -- but still would like to play with the concept!

(LARGE) - Second idea was called:   8 MIN. 20 SEC. (see numerous variations of sketches in the LARGE folder)

This is the time it takes for light from the sun to reach the earth.  I'd like to map a series of photos taken from a static position, from sunrise to sunset, timed at every 8 min, 20 sec.  The project will be documented by a reading of the color (by a colorometer) visualized as a bar of color that will create a palette of the visual space.  The loop will run for 8 min., 20 sec. Again -- really overambitious!

(MEDIUM) Gradated Clock ('time sliding away')
My idea to iterate on this was to have each day/hr/min/sec - be gradated within the 'slices' of the circular divisions as the clock rotated.

(SMALL) Final idea was to have a circular clock -- which remains--
My idea to iterate on this, but very excited that I was able to create this in P5.

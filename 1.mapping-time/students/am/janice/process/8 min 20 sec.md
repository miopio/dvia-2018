## Process

Title:  8 MIN. 20 SEC.

This is the time it takes for light from the sun to reach the earth.  I'd like to map a series of photos taken from a static position, from sunrise to sunset, timed at every 8 min, 20 sec.  The project will be documented by a reading of the color (by a colorometer) visualized as a bar of color that will create a palette of the visual space.  The loop will run for 8 min., 20 sec.

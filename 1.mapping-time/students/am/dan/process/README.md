Time Representation

This is a one-hour count-down time representation project, inspired by the Karl Marx's quote " All that is solid melts into air."
There are 60 lines in the system. Each line represents a minute. With time passing, the lines gradually disappear. When an hour is over and all the lines vanish into air, the system starts over again.

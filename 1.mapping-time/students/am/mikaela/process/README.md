## Process

My clock uses colour and shape to represent the current time of day. The inner arc represents the hours, the middle arc represents the minutes and the outer arc represents the seconds. Each arc contains a different colour to help distinguish between the different times. 

In the future, I hope to add a secondary element that incorporates daylight. My idea is to add straight lines that start at (0,0) but then move in opposite directions to show where the daylight is throughout the clocks cycle. This would be represented using more muted colours during the “dark” hours and brighter colours when it is light out.

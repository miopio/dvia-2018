## Process

My clock uses colour and shape to represent the current time of day. The inner arc represents the hours, the middle arc represents the minutes and the outer arc represents the seconds. Each arc contains a different colour to help distinguish between the different times. 

In the future, I hope to add a secondary element that incorporates daylight. My idea is to add straight lines that start at (0,0) but then move in opposite directions to show where the daylight is throughout the clocks cycle. This would be represented using more muted colours during the “dark” hours and brighter colours when it is light out.

## Description 

For this project, I visualized time in three different ways to ultimately create three versions of working clocks. 

The first clock takes a closer look at only the minutes and seconds to emphasize the smaller features of a clock that are normally forgotten about. By only starting with one arc and gradually increasing them throughout the hour, this clock puts the number of minutes in an hour into perspective.  I chose to specifically visualize only the seconds and minutes aspect of a clock because I feel as though they tend to get lost in many larger clock representations. When reading the clock, one should first look at an individual arc to determine the seconds in the minute and then count the number of arcs to determine the number of minutes that have gone by in the hour so far. 

The second clock is aesthetically similar to the first clock however, introduces the idea of hours in the day on a 12 hour scale. The inner yellow arc represents every second and the middle orange arc represents every minute. Lastly, the outer arc is the hour of the day starting either in the am or pm. Each value of time is created using both an arc and an ellipse. I chose to make the ellipse more transparent than the arc in order to make a contrast between the time that has past and the total time in the cycle. 

My third clock takes the same aspects of the second clock however, includes the progress of the day, month and season. The fifth arc in red represents the progress of the month and ultimately shows the day of the month. As this red arc circles around, suggesting months have gone by, the out quarter arc changes location and colour to represent the season change. Every three months, the outer quarter arc moves to show whether it is spring, summer, fall or winter. This is visualized using colours that I associate with those seasons.

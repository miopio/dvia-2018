## Process

My textless clock shows the current time by using colors, opacity, and size.
Orange represents the AM period and Turquoise represents the PM period.
It starts from 00:00 AM when the circle is at its maximum radius in 100% orange.
As the seconds go by, the opacity changes, for example; 50% orange is 30 seconds.
The circle gets smaller and goes towards the center as the minutes go by.
There are 12 rings, each ring is 1 hour.
When the time is 12:00 PM, the AM period ends and the PM period starts, the
circle color turns into turquoise and it starts growing back as the time passes.

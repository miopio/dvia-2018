## Mapping Time Concepts

**Concept 1 – Large**
My clock shows the current second, minute, hour and date by using colors, opacity, and size.
Orange represents the AM period and Turquoise represents the PM period.
It starts from 00:00 AM when the circle is at its maximum radius in 100% orange.
As the seconds go by, the opacity changes, for example; 50% orange is 30 seconds.
The circle gets smaller and goes towards the center as the minutes go by.
There are 12 rings, each ring is 1 hour.
When the time is 12:00 PM, the AM period ends and the PM period starts, the
circle color turns into turquoise and it starts growing back as the time passes.

Position:
There are two circles that show the date, the small one shows the day and the bigger one shows the month. They orbit around the main clock, depending on their locations we know the date.

**Concept 2 – Medium**
A tree that grow according to the current time, a new branch grows **every 4 seconds**, when one minute passes, oranges fall to the ground.

**Concept 3 – Small**
I used one of the class example's code and modified it. I liked its simplicity and clarity. 3 bars form a square, each bar represents a time value.

My textless clock shows the current time by using colors, opacity, and size.
Orange represents the AM period and Turquoise represents the PM period.
It starts from 00:00 AM when the circle is at its maximum radius in 100% orange.
As the seconds go by, the opacity changes, for example; 50% orange is 30 seconds.
The circle gets smaller and goes towards the center as the minutes go by.
There are 12 rings, each ring is 1 hour.
When the time is 12:00 PM, the AM period ends and the PM period starts, the
circle color turns into turquoise and it starts growing back as the time passes.
=======
My clock shows the current time and date by using colors, opacity, size and position.

Colors:
Orange represents the AM period and Turquoise represents the PM period.

Opacity:
It starts from 00:00 AM when the circle is at its maximum radius in 100% orange.
As seconds go by, the opacity changes, for example; 50% orange is 30 seconds.

Size:
The circle gets smaller until it stops at 12:00 PM or 00:00 midnight, and the color changes.
The number of rings determines the current hour. 

Position:
There are two circles that show the date, the small one shows the day and the bigger one shows the month. They orbit around the main clock, depending on their locations we know the date.

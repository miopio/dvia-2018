## Process

Description of the contents of this folder and a prose description of your ideas for how to represent
the earthquake data geospatially and diagrammatically.


The Initial Idea
I thought it would be interesting to visualize all the earhtquakes which have occured in the recent past. In viewing the data set from USGS,  I was shocked by the sheer frequency of earthquakes. In September 2017 alone, the USGS recorded 8948 earthquakes. (Most of them well below magnitude 3.0 on the Richter Scale.

My process
i started by doing a simple sketch in P5 plotting each event by magnitude (size od circle), on a world map. However, given the number of earthquakes, seeing the relative sizes fo magnitudes became a lost signal. (As the Richter Scale is logarithmic, rather than linear).

which means that an increase of 1 on the scale increases the strength of the earthquake by 10. A magnitude 2 quake is 10 times the strength of a 1 and a 3 is 10 times the strength of a 2. The primary quake in New Zealand, which is almost impossible to see above due to its existence within a large cluster of quakes, was a 7.8



I therefore chose to use Relative magnitude as the size measure.

Questions to ask:
How does the largest of these earthquakes compare to the largest of all time? 
What areas of the world experience the most and largest earthquakes? 
What information is available on historical earthquakes? 

So, I decided to add additional “layers” to the visualization to help answer these questions (the data for all of these were obtained from Wikipedia). 

The visualization now has the following layers:
Recent – The recent earthquakes in the original visualization. (Wikipedia)
Largest – Largest recorded earthquakes. (Wikipedia)
Largest by Country – Largest earthquakes experienced by each country (Note: Not all countries are included).
Pre-1900 Historical – Known earthquakes prior to 1900.


You can view any combination of the different layers together in order to compare and contrast.

Note how small the New Zealand earthquake looks in comparison to the largest of all time, a magnitude 9.5 quake which occurred on May 22, 1960 near Valdivia, Chile. This earthquake was 50 times as powerful as the New Zealand quake and was equivalent to 1,000 atomic bombs.

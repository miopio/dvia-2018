## Process

Description of the contents of this folder and a prose description of your ideas for how to represent
the earthquake data geospatially and diagrammatically.

####Critique
- Don't make everything interactive: if you make tectonic plates interactive, don't make earthquake points interactive
- Think about what to do with "small multiples": Figure out how to display all of them, or do a fade out/in on one graph
- Use same scale for all graphs; maybe no need to label all if axis are completely the same

EARTHQUAKES AND JAPAN 
Japan accounts for about 20 percent of worldwide earthquakes of magnitude 6 or greater. Much of its population is densely concentrated in its most seismically active areas. This series of maps aims to 1) place Japanese earthquake activity in a global context, 2) focus on Japan's seismic activity itself, and 3) zoom in on the Tokyo metropolitan region to show the proximity of Japan's largest population center and capital to earthquake activity. 

map-1
A world map of all earthquakes over m4.5 over the last month, with magnitude encoded by color value. Time of event and event duration indicated in pop-ups.

map-2
An inset map of Japan with all earthquakes over m4.5 over the last month, with magnitude encoded by circle size, color value and opacity. Time of event and event duration indicated in pop-ups.

map-3
An inset map of the Tokyo metropolitan region, the world's largest by population. Earthquakes over m4.5 over the last month are shown with magnitude encoded by circle size, color value and opacity. A Leaflet street map will be overlayed to indicate population density. (If a population density map is available that would be another useful indicator of the high proximity of Japan's people to seismically active zones.)

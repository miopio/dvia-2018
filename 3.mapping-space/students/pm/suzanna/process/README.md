## Process

Exercise 3: Mapping Space and Frames of Reference examines earthquake data geospatially and diagrammatically.  My three processes are ordered in increasing amount of knowledge:  

(1) Visualizes earthquakes via circles which represent earthquake depth (color fill) and earthquake magnitude (radius and circle outline).  The colors are based on the Brewer color palette.

(2) Visualizes earthquakes via circles which represent earthquake depth (color fill) and earthquake magnitude (radius and circle outline).  The colors are based on the Brewer color palette.  In addition, each circle contains a pop-up link to give acutal earthquake value data: place, depth, magnitude.

(3) Visualizes earthquakes via circles which represent earthquake depth (color fill) and earthquake magnitude (radius and circle outline).  The colors are based on the Brewer color palette.  In addition, each circle contains a pop-up link to give acutal earthquake value data: place, depth, magnitude, and related images from Google Images based on the latitude and longitude.

## Process

I chose to focus on the Ring of Fire for this project and I also chose to take a special interest in discussing the tectonic plates activity.

AESTHETIC CHOICES
I tend to favor darker aesthetics in general so I thought this would be a great opportunity to use contrasting colors for this project to really highlight the Ring of Fire (ROF) and Earthquake Data. I chose to use the Black or Black & White (depending on which tile set decides to work) and will make the actual ROF a firey color.

Color Palette:
  Continents
  Black, Charcoal Gray

  Ring of Fire
  Reds, Oranges

  Earthquake Data
  Neon Greens, Neon Yellows, Whites, and Blues

Shapes:
For Earthquake Data I'm keeping circles for now. I will change the shapes before the end if the semester.

Size:
Representing Magnitude


CHALLENGES FACED:
Centering the map and getting the points to wrap the map. Zooming out does not allow viewer to see actual location of Ring of Fire.

The Lat and Long coordinates for Ring of Fire is not exact because it's such a large area, so I decided to use lat/long for the Hawaiian Islands, which are located directly in the middle of the Pacific Plate. Lat/longs did not point to their location
----------------------------------------

THE RING OF FIRE

The Ring of Fire the largest, most active fault line on the planet, holding 75% of the worlds volcanoes and causing more than 90% of the earthquakes and volcanic eruptions around the world.  Shaped like a horseshoe, the Ring of Fire
stretches 25,000 miles from New Zealand in the south to Alaska in the north. From there it heads south along the West Coast of North and South America.

Countries at highest risk of being struck by an earthquake in the Ring of Fire are in the US west coast, Chile, Japan and Pacific islands like the Solomon Islands. Other countries along the fault line include Mexico, Antarctica, Russia, Papa New Guinea, Indonesia, Canada, Peru, Taiwan, Philippines, and Guatemala.


TECTONIC PLATES

The key principle of plate tectonics is that the lithosphere exists as separate and distinct tectonic plates, which float on the fluid-like (visco-elastic solid) asthenosphere. The relative fluidity of the asthenosphere allows the tectonic plates to undergo motion in different directions. This map shows 15 of the largest plates. Note that the Indo-Australian Plate may be breaking apart into the Indian and Australian plates, which are shown separately on this map.

The Ring of Fire is a direct result of plate tectonics: the movement and collisions of lithospheric plates.
  - The eastern section of the ring is the result of the Nazca Plate and the Cocos Plate being subducted beneath the        westward-moving South American Plate.
  - The Cocos Plate is being subducted beneath the Caribbean Plate, in Central America.
  - A portion of the Pacific Plate and the small Juan de Fuca Plate are being subducted beneath the North American Plate.
  - Along the northern portion, the northwestward-moving Pacific plate is being subducted beneath the Aleutian Islands arc. Farther west, the Pacific plate is being subducted along the Kamchatka Peninsula arcs on south past Japan.

The southern portion is more complex, with a number of smaller tectonic plates in collision with the Pacific plate from the Mariana Islands, the Philippines, Bougainville, Tonga, and New Zealand; this portion excludes Australia, since it lies in the center of its tectonic plate. Indonesia lies between the Ring of Fire along the northeastern islands adjacent to and including New Guinea and the Alpide belt along the south and west from Sumatra, Java, Bali, Flores, and Timor.

Additional factors affecting activity include gravity and the Earths rotation.

GLOSSARY OF TERMS
Lithosphere - rigid outer part of the earth consisting of the crust and upper mantle
Asthenosphere - the upper layer of the earth's mantle, below the lithosphere, in which there is relatively low resistance to plastic flow and convection is thought to occur.
Subduction  - a geological process that takes place at convergent boundaries of tectonic plates where one plate moves under another and is forced or sinks due to gravity into the mantle.

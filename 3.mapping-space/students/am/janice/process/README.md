## Process

Description of the contents of this folder and a prose description of your ideas for how to represent
the earthquake data geospatially and diagrammatically.

Sketch 1:  Earthquakes in Los Angeles County -- FREQUENCY concept
Graph is the Rector Scale -- 
Time is in Month, Day and Hour -- As a tremor occurs, the orange line will emanate from the circle of the Time Circle to the point on the Rector Scale.
The Date and time, and the orange line, will stay visualized as a 'map' of the history of the tremors.

Sketch 2:  Earthquakes in California Counties -- SEISMAGRAPHIC concept
The Y scale is the Rector scale, The X scale is the Month/Year
The different colors of varying line weights would indicate the activity in different counties.  The Width would indicate its'SPREAD' 'MAGNITUDE' or how many far its intensity was felt.
The colors would be transparent and overlapping each other.

Sketch 3:  Earthquakes in California -- Tectonic Plates/Fault Lines
The shapes of the Tectonic Plates would slowly move atop a base grayed out map of California.  A pinprick of a circle would show up along the shape of the Tectonic Plate, where the earthquake takes place, along with its location as per city/county.  
Shapes are different colors and would continually be moving along with the data. 

Sketch 4:  Earthquakes in California County -- Time on right (sketch 1) along with the pinprick circle shows up on the map of California.  A film reel below would show a 'slice of life' of the county and would be highlighted as the clock indicates a tremor/earthquake.  The slice of life would have data about the county.

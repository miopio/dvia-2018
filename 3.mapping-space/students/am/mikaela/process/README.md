## Process

Sketch #1: Magnitude and Time of Day (AM or PM)
- Shows the most significant earthquakes of 2018
- Magnitude mapped from smallest to biggest going from inner circle to outer circle
- Time is mapped clock wise around the circle (24 hour clock)
- Shows if more earthquakes occurred during the AM or PM 
- Each earthquake is represented by a point 
    - The point is coloured differently to represent AM or PM 

Sketch #2: Magnitude and Length of Earthquake by Country 
- Shows the 10 most significant earthquakes in the last 10 years (2008-2018)
- Circles represent each earthquake 
    - location is based on map and size is relative to magnitude
- Lines represent time of earthquake in minutes 
- The map is layered underneath/ is integrated with the diagram 
    - Map displays country name 
- Year of earthquake is written below or appears using hover 

Sketch #3: Number of Earthquakes Above and Below Equator 
- Shows the most significant earthquakes between 2010 and 2018 and their distance from equator 
    - Do more earthquakes occur below or above equator?
- Year is mapped on the horizontal access 
- Circles represent earthquakes and size represents magnitude 
- Colour is used to specify above or below equator 
- Map is placed to the right of the diagram

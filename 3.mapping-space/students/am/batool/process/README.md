# Mapping Space Concepts

**concept 1:** a 3D map that shows the location of earthquakes in one day in North America. The bar height determines the earthquakes magnitudes.
The filter panel shows the key to colors which is the average magnitudes.

**concept 2:** a 2D map with circles on the location of earthquakes in one day in North America, the size of magnitude is shown by colors, circles size, and the text. The filter allows the viewer to filter the earthquakes by pointing the arrow to a different range of earthquake magnitude

**concept 3:** A calendar that shows the days of one month, each square shows the number of earthquake happened in that day in circles, the size of magnitude is represented by the colors of circles (sequential colors).

Concepts sketches are in the process file.

## Final Concept:
I went with the first direction, an isometric projection of North America map, that shows the magnitude and depth of October's earthquakes. The UI element is a radio button that allows the viewer to show and hide the depth and magnitude. I used CSS/Javascript and [Kepler.gl](http://kepler.gl/#/) to create this interface.

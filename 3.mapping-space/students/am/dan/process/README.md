## Process

Description of the contents of this folder and a prose description of your ideas for how to represent
the earthquake data geospatially and diagrammatically.

##1
The diagrammatic visualization for idea 1 is construct by 'wave lines'. Each line represents a day(24hours). The between point's width is decided by the time of record, the height of the point depends on the magnitude.The bezier of the point is decided by the depth.    
My approach to the geospatial visualization is indicates in the picture idea 1.

##2
The diagrammatic visualization for idea 2 will contain information includes magnitude, magnitude error, depth, depth error, time, and location. Check the picture for the details
My approach to the geospatial visualization is indicates in the picture idea 2.

##3
 For idea 3 the diagrammatic visualization is representing and grouping the earthquake data happened in the different continent by using the different color. By re-mapping the magnitude and depth of each record, the diagram will show each earthquake in the form of the rectangle.
My approach to the geospatial visualization is indicates in the picture idea 3.

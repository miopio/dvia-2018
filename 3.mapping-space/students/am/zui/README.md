## Process

Description of the contents of this folder and a prose description of your ideas for how to represent
the earthquake data geospatially and diagrammatically.  

Sketch 1: Perspective map with 3-D histogram indicating the depth, different sequential color palette for magnitude for all month data (blue) and significant data (red).  

Sketch 2: 3 layers indicating three levels of depth, and on each layer, magnitude will be represented by the size of circles.  

Sketch 3: monthly data in blue and significant data as red heat map overlay. At bottom, a hotline of depth will be shown on the choosing cluster/avg. of current week/today.

**Notes**  
* Check the scale on wikipedia
* Use qualitative colors to indicate the effect of the magnitude instead of the numeric value

## Final
* Checkbox to check if to show data from the current month
* Slider to show the data from a specific day in the current month period
* Bottom overlay of scatter plot of magnitude-depth of the current week's data

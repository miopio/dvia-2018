Description of the contents of this folder and a prose description of your ideas for how to represent
the earthquake data geospatially and diagrammatically.

I've included a few pieces of reference material of earthquake visualizations that I found Googling around. I have this itch to do something outside of the project perimenters, though, like connecting to realtime tremor data to some sort of sound emitter.

Sketch 01
A tree map of mag data that overlaps the maps or perhaps is regulated to the side. I'm thinking the tree map might adjust as the user drags around the map or perhaps the map is in a fixed position. I could imagine another version where the user could select differet natural disastors. So uplifting. I wonder if any of our projects will focus on a topic not associated with mass destruction? 	

Sketch 02
A pretty straight ahead overlay of earthquake visualizations based on mag data with an interactive timeline. Perhaps playing with a fixed zoom level of the map itself and allowing the user to click and drag.

Sketch 03
Mousing over locations with earthquake data adjusts the bars that are in a fixed, persistent position in the top left. What other date is accessible? What other comparisons might be valuble or interesting?

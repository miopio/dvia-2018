## Process

Design #1: Triangle Graph 
- Triangles used to map the number of tests
- Top triangle represents atmospheric tests
- Bottom triangle represents underground tests
- Brewer color coordinates to the number of tests 
    - The more tests = a darker color 
    - The atmospheric and underground colors are taken from the same palette but opposite ends 

Design #2: Scatter Plot/ Circle Graph 
- Circles used to map the number of tests (similar to design #1)
- Left circle represents atmospheric tests
- Right circle represents underground tests
- Brewer color coordinates to the number of tests 
    - The more tests = a darker color 
    - The atmospheric and underground colors are taken from the same palette but opposite ends 

Design #3: Bar Chart 
- top bar is used to map atmospheric tests
- bottom bar is used to map underground tests
- color and size are used to represent countries tests however the color of the country will change depending on the country with the largest number of tests that year
    - dark red will always represent the country with the most tests done however this may change from US to Russia based on the year 

Sketch #4: Sunburst 
- Inner circle maps the dates 
- Middle circle maps the countries
- Outermost circle maps the number of tests done by each country 
- Colour differentiates the atmospheric tests from the underground tests 
- Year/ Date is also color coded by the total number of tests 
    - Ex. the year with over 50 tests done will have a darker color than the years during the nuclear ban 
- VARIABLE = GDP 
    - would like to add an extra element to show the countries GDP by year and see if that correlates to the number of nuclear tests done

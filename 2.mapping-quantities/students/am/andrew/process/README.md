## Process

Description of the contents of this folder, a prose description of your ideas for how to represent
the nuclear testing time series, and links to external data sources you'll be incorporating into
the project.

#### Concept 1

![concept 1](concept1.png)

- Concept 1 expresses time as a series of single frames. Every second a new year takes over the entire canvas.
- The objects are the text of the country, positioned roughly where they appear on a world map.
- The size of the text indicates the number of tests that year
- Above/underground: Either above or below line (see drawing) or divergent palette whoch colors the text.
- External data set: play top billboard song during each decade (10 seconds)

#### Concept 2

![concept 2](concept2.png)

- Concept 2 uses tally marks for the number of tests per decade
- Vertial scrolly, time on the y axis
- Colors of tally marks will be either blue or red indicating an underground or above ground text

#### Concept 2

![concept 3](concept3.png)

- Heat map style plot
- Time on x axis
- Each country box is split between above and below ground test.

#### Secondary data set

Billboard top songs of each decade

### Final Concept

- There are three categories of data separated by sections:

  1. USA
  2. Russia
  3. Sum of all other countries combined

- Within each country, every nuclear test is represented by a 20px x 20px block (so each test has the same visual weight) stacked in a grid.
- Color represents the decade these tests were conducted.

#### Cultural component

- There are 2 elements of culture used to integate into the nuclear testing data:
  1. The color of the blocks use patterns of the "vibe" of that decade.
  2. Songs of the decade cycle through automatically, or to add slight interactivity (although not necessary), when hovering over the decade block in the legend, that song is selected.

#### Presentation Medium

- The thought here, is that this would be displayed either as long, static or digital poster. As a digital display, the decades would 'activate' every 10 seconds and cylce through the songs and news of the corresponding time period.
  - An'activated' decade would highlight the corresponding tiles, sounds, and patterns
  - Additionally, an interactive installed piece, one could also press the decade tiles in the legend to activate decades manually.

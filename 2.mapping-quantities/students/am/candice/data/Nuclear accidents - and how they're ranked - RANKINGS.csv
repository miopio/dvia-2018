7,Major accident,Major release of radio active material with widespread health and environmental effects requiring implementation of planned and extended countermeasures,,,"Chernobyl, Ukraine, 1986"
6,Serious accident,Significant release of radioactive material likely to require implementation of planned countermeasures.,,,"Kyshtym, Russia, 1957"
5,Accident with wider consequences,"Limited release of radioactive material likely to require  implementation of
some planned countermeasures • Several deaths from radiation","• Severe damage to reactor core.
• Release of large quantities of radioactive material within an installation
with a high  probability of
significant public  exposure. This
could arise from a major criticality accident or fire",,"Windscale, UK, 1957; Three Mile Island, 1979"
4,Accident with local consequences,"• Minor release of radioactive material unlikely to result in implementation of planned countermeasures other than
local food controls.
• At least one death from  radiation.","• Fuel melt or damage to fuel resulting in more than 0.1%  release of core inventory.
• Release of significant quantities of radioactive
material within an  installation with a high probability of significant
public exposure.",,"FUKUSHIMA 1, 2011"
3,Serious incident,"• Exposure in excess of ten times the statutory annual limit for workers.
• Non-lethal deterministic health effect (e.g., burns) from radiation.","• Exposure rates of more than 1 Sv/h in an  operating area.
• Severe contamination in an area not expected by design, with a
low probability
of significant public exposure.","• Near accident at a nuclear power plant
with no safety provisions remaining.
• Lost or stolen highly radioactive sealed source.
• Misdelivered highly radioactive sealed source without adequate procedures in place to handle it.","Sellafield, UK, 2005"
2,Incident,"• Exposure of a member of the public
in excess of 10 mSv.
• Exposure of a worker in excess of the
statutory annual limits","• Radiation levels in an operating area
of more than 50 mSv/h.
• Significant contamination within the
facility into an area not expected by
design","• Significant failures in safety provisions
but with no actual consequences.
• Found highly  radioactive sealed
orphan source, device or transport
package with safety provisions intact.
• Inadequate packaging of a highly
radioactive sealed  source.","Atucha, Argentina, 2005"
1,Anomaly,,,"• Overexposure of a member of the
public in excess of statutory annual
limits.
• Minor problems with safety
components with significant
defence-in-depth remaining.
• Low activity lost or stolen radioactive
source, device or transport package",

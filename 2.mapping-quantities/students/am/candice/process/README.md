## Process
1. Idea 1
The orange circles represent atmospheric tests and blue represents underground tests. I put the countries on the left hand side and the years across the top. The totals are represented at the bottom. The number of tests grow larger by size.      

2. Idea 2
The orange circles represent atmospheric tests and blue represents underground tests. I put the countries on the left hand side and the years across the top. The totals are represented at the bottom. In this version, I connected the circles with a vertical line to show the direct connection between year and tests. The number of tests grow larger by size.    

3. Idea 3
In this idea, I divided the years and countries into a grid. The number of tests are represented by the intensity of the color. If there are a lot of tests, the colors would be very saturated and if there are not that many in a certain year it would be more opaque. The totals would be represented by size at the bottom.

Description of the contents of this folder, a prose description of your ideas for how to represent
the nuclear testing time series, and links to external data sources you'll be incorporating into
the project.

External Data: This is the source of my external data, which is all the accidents that happened due to nuclear plants. https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/mar/14/nuclear-power-plant-accidents-list-rank

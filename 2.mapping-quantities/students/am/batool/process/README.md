## Mapping Quantities Concepts

**Concept 1 and the Final one**:

*Data used: Years + Underground/atmospheric + Total tests*
The data visualization is consisted of vertical lines, each line represents a year from 1945-2017, another line cuts through the vertical lines from the center horizontally, which is the baseline that holds the total number of Nuclear tests in red circles in that year.
Every year some countries had done the Nuclear Testing above or underground, and this could be determined by looking at the position of the vertical line, if the baseline is at 50% of the vertical line, it means that in that year atmospeheric and underground testing are equal in percentages.
The red cicrles sizes show the overall total Nuclear tests in every year.

**Concept 2**:

*Data used: U.S. Total tests + U.S. military budget in Cold War.*
Two bar graphs face each other, the first graph is for the military total spending in billion dollars, the y-axis holds a scale from 0-260 billion dollars, and the x-axis holds the years from 1948-1987. The second graph on the right shows the total number of nuclear tests 1948-1987, the y-axis contains a scale from 0-100 and x-axis the timeline.

**Concept 3:**

*Data used: Countries + Total Tests + Longitudes and Latitudes.*
Custom design of the world map done in mapbox, the long and lat degreses values are converted into canvas x and y points, each country is labeled in a unique color, every nuclear testing for every country is shown in a small circle on the map.

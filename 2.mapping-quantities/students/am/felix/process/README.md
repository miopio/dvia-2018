# Process

## My Notes

Sorry, this is still very chaotic.

### External Variables:

1. Military Spending - worldbank
2. Cancer incident rate – https://hsus-cambridge-org.libproxy.newschool.edu/HSUSWeb/table/showtablepdf.do?id=Bd490-512
- Located near testing sites
3. Stock price of Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Honeywell Int.
4. Consumption of mushrooms in Russia
5. Number of teddy bear sales – https://hsus-cambridge-org.libproxy.newschool.edu/HSUSWeb/table/jumpto.do?id=Dd498-560
6. Number of nuclear weapons / Nuclear arsenal U.S. - https://hsus-cambridge-org.libproxy.newschool.edu/HSUSWeb/toc/tableToc.do?id=Ed223-227 (strategic nuclear weapons: 1945–1996), Budget for nuclear weapons
7. Technology advance – https://hsus-cambridge-org.libproxy.newschool.edu/HSUSWeb/table/downloadtable.do?id=Cg258-264 (Performance indicators of computers and transistors: 1946–2000)
8. Historical Facts – https://hsus-cambridge-org.libproxy.newschool.edu/HSUSWeb/toc/tableToc.do?id=Ed228 (U.S. arms control and weapons treaties and agreements: 1922–1996)

#### Idea

Atomic bomb in reverse:

#### Class discussion and ideas

- Brad: Lat/long, yield
- Zui: International conflicts (Source: US Davis). Number of conflicts, casualties
- Andrew: Most popular song of each year
- Candice: Number of bombs that have been lost
- Felix: Civil defense groups, bunkers.
    - Fallout shelters
    - Energy & money that was spent on surviving
- Not stock prices, but network of contractors
    - Freight trains
    - economic network


##### Stories:
1. Mapping + Timeline (Atmospheric, underground, country)
2. Reversing the nuclear bomb: treaties and policies
3. Defense systems (Expenditure, Location)
4. Accidents (Location/map)
5. One test and the data / functions of it
6. Bombs that went missing
7. Just looking at one bomb – Tsar

##### Suggestion:
1. Timeline of tests/yields grouped in decades (individual tests, vs yields)
2. Insecurities in telling a story about nuclear testing
    1. Min/Max yield, no yield, yield

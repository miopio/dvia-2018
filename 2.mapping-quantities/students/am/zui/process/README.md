## Process

* Changed port in package.json from 8080 to 8000  

1. Concept 1: inverse bar chart with divergent palette
  * Divergent palette: darker color means larger number
    * Blue: atmospheric
    * Red: underground
  * Green overlay rectangle: 96' treaty
  * Grey squares at bottom show the totals
2. Concept 2: side-to-side bar chart on a timeline
  * Qualitative palette: each country a color
  * Horizontal timeline also implies the "ground"
  * Positive vertical direction: atmospheric
  * Negative vertical direction: underground
  * Marked the treaty on the timeline
  * Dark bubbles on the years show the totals
3. Concept 3: with extra data of inter state war involvement
  * Reference: Zeev Maoz, Paul L. Johnson, Jasper Kaplan, Fiona Ogunkoya, and Aaron Shreve 2019. The Dyadic Militarized Interstate Disputes (MIDs) Dataset Version 3.0: Logic, Characteristics, and Comparisons to Alternative Datasets, Journal of Conflict Resolution (forthcoming).
  * Sequential palette: darker color means larger number
  * Each circle represents a year
  * Above time axis:
    * Upper semicircle: atmospheric
    * Lower semicircle: underground
    * Black dot: involvement in a interstate war

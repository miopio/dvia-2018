  * Sequential palette: darker color means larger number
  * Each circle represents a year
  * Above time axis:
    * Upper semicircle: atmospheric
    * Lower semicircle: underground  
    **v3**  
    * Black dot: involvement in a interstate war
    * Line connecting dots: length/period of the war  
    **v2**  
    * small circles: involvement in a interstate war
    * Line connecting dots: length/period of the war
    * Line weight: number of stated involved in the war  
    **v3**  
    * Width of arcs: length/period of the war
    * Arc line weight: number of stated involved in the war  
    **final**  
    * Empty circle (uncolored) to represent 0 test
    * Only count total tests (no division of above/underground)
    * Variance in y-coords (lines at different vertical levels) inside a circle to represent different wars involving the same state
    * Added non nuclear power states' war involvement at the bottom

## Process

Concept 1 -- I first tried to sketch out a hierarchy of the information, and how the x and y axis then needed a z axis.  I incorporated a year gradated bar to show how we lightened up into the year 1996, when the nuclear ban on testing occured.  I used a 'grid' to show the amount of tests, which was pulled directly from the csv files.

Concept 2 -- My attempt to do a vertical visualization of the years failed.  I also was so tired of the 'grid' idea that I wanted to try something more fun and organic, but soon realized that it was too funky.  It turned out that the blobs were not too clear, and the colors weren't enough to distinguish the testing countries, nor did the shapes mean anything other than a randomized shape, which I thought the code could create.  However, the information/data was too disturbing for this design to be of any value.

Concept 3 -- I went back to the clarity of the first concept and added the element of the map that would light up the "LOCATION" of the test.  I think with the brevity of this information and our known facts of the dangers of nuclear waste, that its important to know where the testing has occurred.  The location in the URL (simply Wikepedia) also had the latitude and longitude of the locations.  As you pan over the 'grid'  == the location would visualize, along with the information of the testing site.

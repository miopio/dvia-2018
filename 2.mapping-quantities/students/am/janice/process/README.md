Mapping Quantities - Nuclear Testing, Above and Below ground from 1946 - 2017 by Country.

First iteration -- simply getting all csv files (atmostpheric and underground data provided) into a bar chart without references to countries -- 
Second iteration - Trying to visualize the data in 'blob' form -- the idea was to 'mutate' the data -- but turned out, with the divergent color choice turned into a party invitation.  However, all data was correct.
Third and final - I realized that this information about Nuclear testing was really seriously impactful on our environment and people -- in reading -- the testing had been taking place in usually isolated areas of the '1st world' countries -- and I decided to show the spots on the maps where the testing was being performed by the country.  Further - I wanted to show the lifespan of those areas -- ( but was unable to find the data in a short period of time) -- 
    a.  Panning over the areas where the testing takes place -- a popup would occur -- giving information about that area, types of people    and what is currently happening there.

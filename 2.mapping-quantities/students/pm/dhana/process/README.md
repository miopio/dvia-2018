## Process

In this project I am attempting to visualize the data in reference to an interview I recently heard on NPR with renowned pop astrophysicist Neil DeGrasse Tyson. In this interview, he discusses his new book entitled "Accessory to War: The Unspoken Alliance Between Astrophysics and the Military" where he names the "curiously complicit alliance" between a nation's global conquests and innovation in science and technology. With that in mind, here are some of the design ideas I was initially aiming for:

SUB VARIABLE
I would love to be able embed the additional variables as links within the timeline. I'm considering these options:
- geopolitical factors
- American economic power **
  https://ourworldindata.org/military-spending
- scientific & technological innovation **
- environmental impact
  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4165831/ (this would require focusing on atmospheric data)
* I'm also really interested in the corresponding shifts in cultural attitudes and changes in pop culture, but I'm
choosing to represent that in the color choices in the test data instead.

DATA TYPE
I'm interested in visualizing divergent data with this set, because I would like to tell a more complete story behind what motivates the acceleration of nuclear arms production.

HOW TO DISPLAY DATA
I'd like the background/canvas to gradually change color to display "hot" and "cool" affect, according to growth and lull periods of global nuclear arms testing. It might be more interesting to also show it as the actual totals of the data in addition to the hot and cool color scheme to express time spatially.

The mushroom clouds would be different sizes to represent the number of tests, and colors to represent the years.

DESIGN IDEAS
Color considerations:
- use gray scale for tests in 40s & 50s
  represent wholesome black and white television, a la Leave It to Beaver, and news reels

- use burnt oranges, yellows, greens, & browns for 60s & 70's
  represent "funky" color schemes, Vietnam War, cynicism, and apathy

- use reds, blues, whites, hot/white, and purples for 80's & 90's
  cold war, Coca-Cola, Olympics, boy bands, pop music

- use "Milennial pink" (aka rose gold), beiges, whites, and charcoal black for 2000 - present
  information & attention economy, first generation completely online, resurgence of activism

Typography considerations:
Unsure, still consulting.

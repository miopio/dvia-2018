## Process

Description of the contents of this folder, a prose description of your ideas for how to represent
the nuclear testing time series, and links to external data sources you'll be incorporating into
the project.

Concept 1
This approach attempts to make a clear perceptual distinction between atmospheric and underground tests by drawing the atmospheric tests as circles in the upper half of the canvas and underground tests in the lower half. A divergent palette further emphasizes the diifference.

Concept 2
By inputing a sequential red palette range to the text itself, this concept represents test totals via the intensity of the color value when each year is drawn. The aim is for maximum simplicity.

Concept 3
Each country/year is assigned a square box to draw a heat map. A sequential yellow-red-brown palette is applied to each box to represent the number of tests for each country in a given year. The 0-30 range balances the need to highlight years with many tests and those with few.

Concept 4
This concept incorporates an external data source from Our World in Data that tracks nuclear weapons arsenals over time: https://ourworldindata.org/nuclear-weapons. Warhead data is visualized as raw numbers with color values inputed to the text. 

Concept 5
Data on testing is reincorporated below warhead data. Countries' test totals against their own highs and test totals vs the highest annual figure for any country are visualized as raw numbers with color values inputed to the text.

Concept 6
The four loops are redrawn as rectangle-based heat maps with varying sets of colors. Lines are drawn to indicate decades. Explanatory text and titles are overlayed.

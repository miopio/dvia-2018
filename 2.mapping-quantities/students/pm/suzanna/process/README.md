## Process

Description of the contents of this folder, a prose description of our ideas for how to represent
the nuclear testing time series, and links to external data sources incorporated into
the project.

Three concepts:
(1) A peace of the pie
(2) Crossing the line
(3) Money and Bombs

The external data source visualized in (3) above is from the United Nations:

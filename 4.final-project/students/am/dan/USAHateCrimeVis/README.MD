## Description:
FBI UCR program publishes USA Hate Crime Statistics every year. After looking
through the data, I find it very unsettling that there was a sharp increase of hate
crime cases in 2017. It is not hard to connect this increase to the political climate of
2017. But through researching, clearer answers will be revealed. It is crucial to for
everyone to be aware of this information.For this project I am planning to visualize the trends of the
incidents of hate crime by bias motivation from 2014-2017 in detail to examine and
help people understand this issue.

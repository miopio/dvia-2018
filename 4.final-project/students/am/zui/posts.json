I'm very chill/drama free and incredibly considerate. I'm super clean and neat; especially of the common area. I'm really social and outgoing, but definitely not one to bring the party home. During the week, Ill either come home and watch tv in my room with a glass of wine or I'll be out grabbing dinner/drinks with friends (huge foodie). I love discovering and trying new things. I'm also always going to concerts and different live acts. I enjoy watching sports; especially football (Jets Fan!). \n\nAbout you: I'm looking for someone I can easily get along and be friendly with. I've gone through some awful roommates in the past, and I would like to avoid that at all costs. \n\nLooking for someone who is clean, chill, and considerate. I am exhausted after a long day in the office and enjoy having a calm, relaxing environment to come home to. \n\nFeel free to conctact me with a little information about yourself and any questions that you may have.

We are in a perfect location for NYC Marathon Runners - as we are very close to the finish line!\n\nThe East River Esplanade is approximately a 25 minute walk.\n\nShopping is plentiful including Bloomingdales, Barney's, Bendel's and Bergdorf-Goodman. We are one avenue away from Madison Avenue's most select and high end boutiques. Urban conveniences make living here a breeze, and there are basic living facilities and shops within walking distance, including Whole Foods Market, Duane Reade Pharmacy, a shoe repair, dry cleaners, nail salons, hair salons, Starbucks and much more.\n\nPublic transportation around NYC is made easy from this location. Consider using the subway station at 60th Street / Lexington Avenue, which serves the 4, 5, 6, N, Q, R trains and F train on 63rd Street (all servicing up and downtown) (express and local). Bus located around the corner. The subway will take you to the Southern tip of the city (Freedom Towers - 9/11 Memorial) within 20 minutes.\n\nThe house is a six minute walk to Central Park and Fifth Avenue, 12 minutes to Times Square by Taxi and 11-14 minutes by subway; Grand Central Station is one subway stop away (take the 4 or 5 one stop from 59th street to Grand Central Station); walking distance to Fifth Avenue and Midtown East with its ubiquitous Corporate Offices as well as midtown Manhattan's exclusive Decoration & Design building (D&D building) and Manhattan Art and Antiques Center. Architects, Designers and Collectors from around the world travel to this area for its concentration of design and home furnishings showrooms and galleries.\n\nThe country's best hospitals and medical facilities including Memorial Sloan Kettering, Weill Cornell Medical College, Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital, New York-Presbyterian hospital, Lenox Hill Hospital, the Hospital for Special Surgery and Mount Sinai Hospital are ideally located minutes away from the house.\n\nMINIMUM AGE REQUIREMENT = 10 YEARS: 1871 House is a converted 146 year old Brownstone. In that it is an historic building constructed in the year 1871 there is no elevator and all suites are accessed by our central open staircase. Regretfully, this feature (the house's unenclosed staircase) makes it unsafe for young children under 10 years of age to stay in the house.",

Russel Sage was a financier who was heavily involved with the construction of the NYC subway system. The building was then purchased in 1949 by Catholic Charities and converted as a residence for retired priests and nuns. It was sold again in the 1970s and made into an apt rental building, and was finally converted to coops in 1988 by Michael Beloff. A famous below ground brothel, complete with long mahogany bar, red velvet walls, and secluded hot tubs with overhead chains (all of which survived until about 10 years ago) operated in the building's basement in the 1930s and 40s (accessed thru the side door to the building on 22nd Street). That area is now occupied by storage cages available to Sage House residents. The Sage house was declared a historic landmark in 2000.\n\nSee the building history on Wikipedia under \"Russel Sage Foundation.\"\n\n\nNOTE: TO SAVE EVERYONE TIME AND EFFORT, READ THIS ENTIRE POST BEFORE REPLYING.\n\n\nBROKERS WELCOME\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.",

  "body": "INTRODUCTION \n\nI've been lived in this great apartment for 9 years and found it perfect for both living alone and now living with my wife. We're looking for someone to sublet it. It's the quintessential 1st floor East Village apartment with gorgeous 12ft ceilings and hardwood floors. It's centrally located on E.13th between 1st and 2nd literally steps from great restaurants, Union Square (4,5,6,L,N,R) and the closest L stop to Brooklyn (14th and 1st). One of the great features is you are located on the 1st floor, just up the entryway steps, but the bedroom is located in the back giving you the privacy and quiet you need. Please note the apartment can be rented FULLY FURNISHED.\n\nLIVING ROOM\n\nLocated in the front of the apartment, the 6ft windows look out onto the street. The living room is furnished with TV, Entertainment Stand, Love Seat (that folds out into a bed), armchair, coffee table, lamps, bookshelf, high table for eating, surround sound, and two mirrors. It's a very comfy room. Once again, the apartment can come fully furnished.\n\nKITCHEN\n\nWe've done a lot to make the kitchen comfortable and easy to cook in. There's quite a bit of usable counter space, good sized fridge, oven, and microwave. You will also get the use of pots and pans along with silverware, plates and glasses. The air conditioner for both the Living Room and the Kitchen is located in the kitchen and provides great cool air for both the Kitchen and the Living Room.. \n\nBATHROOM\n\nBathroom is pretty standard and in good, clean working order: Sink, Toilet and Shower. Good storage in medicine cabinet, under the sink and a storage cabinet over the toilet.\n\nBEDROOM\n\nLocated in the back of the apt, the bedroom comes with a queen sized bed and a TV. It's small, but what's great is...THERE'S ANOTHER ROOM BEHIND THE BEDROOOM that's been converted into a WALK-IN CLOSET. It's a dream. People are literally shocked when they see it. While most people in NYC are struggling for storage space...this will not be your fate if you sublet this apartment.\n\nPlease email with questions or to set-up a time to take a look.\n\nADDITIONAL NOTES:.\n- You will have someone you can call if something goes wrong in the apartment.\n- First month and security due upon signing.\n- Pets OK",

  "body": "Our home is a sunny, large (1,200 SQF) one bedroom apartment with hardwood floors at the top floor of a historic, pre-war, Brownstone building. Four windows, north + south facing, exposed brick walls, a fully equipped kitchen, and French doors to a separate bedroom with windows overlooking Harlem. Shower and bath. High speed internet. A beautiful, cozy, escape away from the bustle of NYC, while only 20 min from downtown Manhattan! There is a Queen bed and comfy sofa (with fold-out Queen bed), two good ceiling fans, and often an excellent cross breeze from north-south opposing windows. This building is a Brownstone so it's not as modern as some apartments, but its beautiful, everything works, and the apartment is spotless.\n\nLogistics: We will be away from November 2018 - June 2019 when our lease ends. If you like the place, you can take over the lease, and renew for another year/two years. Its a great flat, and we are very sad to leave, but we are moving abroad. We are subletting the apartment furnished, and the subletter is responsible for paying internet and electricity (ConEd) bills while subletting.\n\nSecurity: two doors at entrance to the apartment block lead into a corridor with bike storage, with third door (to the apartment) on the fourth floor. \n\nOther things to note:\n1. Two blocks from Marcus Garvey Park, thirteen blocks from Central Park\n2.

The downstairs has an open layout with a living room spilling into a dining area and a fantastic cook's kitchen that has too many cool features to name here. If you love to cook, you'll love the kitchen. There is also a separate front parlor room and full bathroom downstairs with walk-in shower. \n\nUpstairs you'll find three large bedrooms, 2 more full baths, and a big laundry room with full-size washer and dryer (this also doubles as a guest room). There are windows in every room because the house is semi-detached. Even the bathrooms receive good natural light through large interior windows and skylight. The huge master bedroom has 4 south-facing windows and is sun-drenched all day. \n\nCrown Heights offers plenty of restaurants and food shopping, and we're 2 express stops from Downtown Brooklyn. Super convenient to subway. Just a 2 minute walk to two subway lines (3, 4), one of which runs express to Manhattan in 15 minutes. \n\nWe have a car and garage which may be available. For more photos, please be in touch.  \n\nAvailable Jan. 27 through end of June, possibly through summer as well. This is an incredible opportunity to live in a beautiful home affordably. \n\nTwo options for sublet:\nSHARE: To rent all 3 bedrooms and shared common areas, $3950/month.\nPRIVATE: For the whole space to yourselves, $4900/month.",

  "body": "Hi,\nI'm looking for someone to take on my lease finishing in June. \nThe apartment is at the perfect location in Prospect heights.\n\nIt's a 5 min walk to a bunchhhh of main subway lines near Grand Army Plaza (2/3, 4/5, B, Q), prospect park and close to many groceries and a gym.\n\nThe room is huge and have a great window with a view on a tree and natural light. \nYou would have your own bathroom (luxury!!).\n\nOn top of this, we have a washing machine and drying machine in the apartment as well as a dishwasher and AC for the summer. \n\nThe apartment would be most likely furnished.\n\nYou would live with two amazing roommates. They are both friendly with 9-5 jobs. We usually hang in the living room in the evening but you could also hang in your own room (since it's so big!).\n\nThe room could be available starting Dec 10th.\n\nYou would be taking over my lease starting now and ending in June.\n\nI want to find the best fit possible for the new roommate so make sure you write me and tell me more about and provide social media handle or LinkedIn profile. :)\n\nThe leasing company is very straight with the income. They would need to do all the credit check and make sure you are currently employed with pay stub proof.",

The downstairs has an open layout with a living room spilling into a dining area and a fantastic cook's kitchen that has too many cool features to name here. If you love to cook, you'll love the kitchen. There is also a separate front parlor room and full bathroom downstairs with walk-in shower. \n\nUpstairs you'll find three large bedrooms, 2 more full baths, and a big laundry room with full-size washer and dryer (this also doubles as a guest room). There are windows in every room because the house is semi-detached. Even the bathrooms receive good natural light through large interior windows and skylight. The huge master bedroom has 4 south-facing windows and is sun-drenched all day. \n\nCrown Heights offers plenty of restaurants and food shopping, and we're 2 express stops from Downtown Brooklyn. Super convenient to subway. Just a 2 minute walk to two subway lines (3, 4), one of which runs express to Manhattan in 15 minutes. \n\nWe have a car and garage which may be available.

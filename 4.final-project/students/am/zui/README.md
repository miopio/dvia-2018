1. Scrapped Craigslist NYC Apartment listing posts
2. Extracted all the images embedded in the posts
3. Ran objection detection algorithm to detect the objects in the images
4. Grouped data by boroughs and neighborhoods
5. Word Cloud for visulzation

**Note**
* neighborhoods.html worked well in both Chrome and Safari
* Buttons for borough visualizations (`html`s in `/boros` folder) **only** work in Safari

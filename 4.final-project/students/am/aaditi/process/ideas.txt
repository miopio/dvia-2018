Final project ideas:

1. Flight performance: The U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics tracks the on-time performance of domestic flights operated by large air carriers. Summary information on the number of on-time, delayed, canceled, and diverted flights is published in DOT's monthly Air Travel Consumer Report and in this dataset of 2015 flight delays and cancellations.

3. Mental health in Tech 
(OSMI) Open Sourcing Mental Illness is a non-profit, 501(c)(3) corporation dedicated to raising awareness, educating, and providing resources to support mental wellness in the tech and open source communities.

Data : 2016 : OSMI Mental Health in Tech Survey. We are interested in gauging how mental health is viewed within the tech/IT workplace, and the prevalence of certain mental health disorders within the tech industry.

It also is mentioned in talks we give at tech conferences. It was targeted in this sense. As this was very much an opt-in survey, some self-selection bias is probably present (those who are more interested in mental health issues for one reason or another are more likely to respond)

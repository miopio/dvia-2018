SYRIAN MIGRATION (refugees) FROM 2011-2017

The Syrian war has horrified all people around the world -- The U.S. involvement began almost with the start -- when the start of the Arab Spring uprising in 2011, which rocked the entire middle east.

Here is a good timeline of the War:   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria

Since there is surprisingly not accessible data (except where I've inserted my data from:  https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/syria
and https://data.world/unhcr/registered-syrian-refugees

Worked on a simple bar chart with the numbers of refugees from 2011 - 2017.

Sketches include data of age breakdown, as well as real people/stories, which I find is more humanizing and tells a story more so than just the immense numbers of refugees.  Variations of sketches are in the process folder -- 

Also, want to correlate eventful dates (poison gassing their own people, Russian bombing/U.S. bombing, reelection of  Bashar al-Assad, president, etc.)

Last sketch was to work on an Neurath type static graph --

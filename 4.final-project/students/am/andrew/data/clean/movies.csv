Gordon (Gary Oldman) meets Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) in Dent's office, and after Harvey questions Gordon about his involvement with the Batman, Gordon requests search warrants for five banks that are holding the remainder of the mob's money. Dent agrees to back Gordon's search warrants, forming a tenuous trust with the honest Gordon, who in turn hails Dent as Gotham's ""White Knight.""",16,"After Batman (Christian Bale) abducts Lau, the dubious accountant working for Gotham's criminal underworld, from his penthouse office building in Hong Kong and delivers Lau to Gordon back in Gotham, Rachel (Maggie Gyllenhaal) interrogates Lau, who agrees to give the names of all his clients (mobsters) and their pooled investments. Dent can now link all 549 criminals together using the RICO case of conspiracy.",38,"At the press conference Batman told Dent to set up so that he could turn himself in, Dent explains that Batman is a vigilante but that the people of Gotham should hold him accountable and not give in to the fear The Joker (Heath Ledger) has unleashed upon Gotham. But as Bruce Wayne is about to come forward to reveal the truth, Dent announces that he himself is the Batman and gets handcuffed and taken away.",71,"After Rachel dies and half of Dent's face is burnt beyond recognition from explosions set by The Joker, Dent is recovering at Gotham General, where The Joker, disguised as a nurse, enters Harvey's room and explains to Dent (who now refers to himself as Two-Face) that he needs to introduce a little anarchy and chaos. The Joker unties Two-Face and hands him a pistol. Two-Face, bent on revenge, flips his coin to decide whether or not to shoot The Joker, which The Joker agrees is only fair. ",107,"The engines of two ferries – one with criminals and one with civilians – lose power, and The Joker informs the passengers of both boats that they're part of a social experiment. Both boats are set with explosives, each boat having a detonator to the other. If the occupants of one boat don't agree to destroy the other boat by midnight, The Joker will blow up both. But the ultimate twist is on The Joker, as neither of the two ferries will press the button, showing that there is still hope for Gotham.",120,152

Marlin’s father shows up to prevent him from doing so, but Nemo defies his father’s wishes and touches the boat anyway. But just as he’s about to swim back in, he is captured by two divers. Marlin has no choice but to frantically swim after the divers, who get in their boat and motor away.",15,"Having only an address gleaned from a pair of the diver’s goggles, which fell off the boat that took his son, Marlin has been blindly making his way across the ocean when he gets directions from a school of fish and sets out with his traveling companion, Dory (Ellen Degeneres), but instead of following the fishes’ instructions, they swim over a canyon and are surrounded by jellyfish. Marlin does all he can to save Dory from the jellies before fainting himself.",48,"Dory and Marlin are trapped in the belly of a whale. Marlin gives up all hope of escaping, but he won’t follow Dory to the back of the throat. Finally, Dory convinces him to “Let go,” and he literally lets go and he falls deeper into the whale.

When the DeLorean carrying Doc's dog Einstein disintegrates in a flash of lighting, flames shooting between their legs, Doc is ecstatic shouting, “Eighty-eight miles per hour!” Marty can only look on in horror thinking that Doc has killed Einstein.

As luck would have it, Doc wakes up, revealing that he is wearing a bulletproof vest. To Marty's astonishment, Doc hands him a taped-up copy of the letter.

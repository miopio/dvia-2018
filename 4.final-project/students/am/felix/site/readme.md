# Ways to visualize Inequality

## Initial thoughts
My interest in this topic was sparked by a graph showing a timeline of one inequality indicator, I can’t remember which one, but it suggested that contemporary inequality reaches levels that are similar to those around 100 years ago, can’t remember if this graph started pre-WW I or after. I found the graph remarkable, of course it reflected and affirmed my bias and I thought it could be a powerful tool of communication, maybe persuasion, that despite the narrative of constant technological progress & economic, we are facing such an immense failure in societal growth.

As boring as a simple line graph might be, I kind of got obsessed with the process of making one specially in this context. A line is the result of plenty decisions - conscious or unconscious, informed or uninformed – determined not only by the author(s), but by the tools, the medium, context and conventions.

When looking at visualizations of inequality we can think of at least four domains in which decisions have to be made:

1. Inequality dimension: What is considered inequality and by which indicator is it measured?
2. Context dimension: How, where, when and what object/subject is measured?
3. Statistics / data handling: How is the aggregated data processed mathematically/ statistically?
4. Aesthetic dimension: which design conventions, (gestalt) principles to visualizing information are applied to convey information about the data to the reader/user?

––– Description of the Graph UI:

And after thinking about it for a while the line graph that impressed me so much initially lost a lot of it’s appeal and I think it’s due to the fact, that I wasn’t sure how decisions were made in these four domains and I wanted to understand that, maybe by de-constructing it, but maybe this is already the wrong term for it. If we accept the conception for a moment, that we are currently experiencing a crisis of representation, I think this notion might be a result of the fact that we are constantly and simultaneously subject to highly elaborate, effective and increasingly divisive naturalizing as well as deconstructing techniques in our environment. Of course the graph first appealed to me, it confirmed my bias, but soon I realized, that it might not convince anyone who didn’t share that bias. What kind of common ground could we share to evaluate this graph? Today discourses of seem short-circuited: Instead of agreeing on acknowledging the process of information gathering and presentation as biased and trying to identify how much and in which direction the information might be tainted, we instantaneously skip to entirely rejecting the information and shutting down communication. I think as someone who is invested in trying to visualize information today it is a challenge to navigate this space where the risk of shutting down communication lies on both sides of a very fine line, naturalizing and deconstructing can both shut down communication and so much of common ground might be eroded that it has to be rebuilt on the way.

Out of this considerations I want to create a platform and maybe a tool to  navigate the space of the fine line, but also other ways to visualize inequalities, to give orientation and make decisions more transparent, I’d consider this a small success if it helped enabling discourse.



## Outline for the rest of the documentation.
- Four ways I want to approach this: Talk about the decisions, tag/structure them, try alternative version, and allow the user to manipulate the graph directly
- In no way do I want to talk badly (?) the work of my colleagues. I just want to make my thoughts about it accessible, for people with similar interest: To understand the different ways to visualize inequality. – I’m new to this myself.
- Current focus on material inequality, I think it’s a good starting point!

                When talking about inequality people can mean very different things. Inequality is not always as material and obvious as a the question who owns what. It can be as subtle as what narratives are considered important. The definition of inequality, its extent and implications are highly contested domains in the political practice.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Data and their presentation are rhetorical tools that can be used with the most humble intentions or to gain momentum over an political opponent. Often the result renders opaque what decisions were made to get the final result and what decidedly has been left out.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Social researchers and economist for example can be interested in different kinds of contexts in regards to time frames, geospatial focuses and sub-groups of the population.
                </p>
                <p>
                   Likewise statisticians can chose form a variety of methods to calculate unequal distributions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Finally the presentation of the result can take very different forms.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To get an understanding of what guides these decisions it is important to make them visible. Hence, my method is to illustrate these decisions analyzing more or less well-known examples, some strong and some with potential for improvement. I would consider this a valuable exercise it helped reading representations of inequality or making more informed decisions when creating them.

                    This blog or platform idea was sparked by Catherine Mulbrandon’s graph showing the income distribution of New York in 2009. Being in New York I realized how different inequalities are conceived in comparison to the cities in Germany, where I come from, I wanted to understand how different inequalities might look like when you look at data but also understand different approaches in trying to represent them.

                    After 2008 the comparison of the 99 % versus the top 1 % percent gained momentum as a rhetorical device in the political toolset. Would different message have been conveyed if the author had chosen a different comparison?

                I reduced the individual shape of the empire state building to just bars. Even though it makes the graph unique and memorable, it makes it difficult to see the right proportions. I used different comparisons to see if new relations can be revealed.

                  In my point of view all of these comparisons seem similarly dramatic, maybe the middle one could convey a more equal distribution at first, but seeing the different income groups that these shares relate to, it really isn’t.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Even though you get a similar picture from all of these graphs I think it’s still valuable to show all of them in context of each other, because they complement each other. And the more research I’m doing on material inequalities it appears to me that there’s not a single gap between the rich and the poor, but there are actually a lot of gaps between different groups.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Compared to the national distribution that I’m discussing in more detail in another post it seems like the top earners are a bit better off in New York than in the rest of the country, which means of course the lower income groups do worse.

                  Material inequalities can be measured with different direct monetary indicators. Given a specific population usually wealth distributions are considered to show a more dramatic variation than income distributions and research on consumption usually show the most “equal” results. I saw Bharti’s graph as an opportunity to compare income and wealth developtment in India between 1961 and 2015.

                    Even though I really like clean, straightforward and minimalist graphs, I wanted to add a little bit of context and some information to this graph. The least amount of context would be to include the zero on the y-axis. While I think it can also be omitted in a lot of cases, I think in this case it’s dramatizing the development of the curve too much and sacrifices the ability to see the complete  height under the line, as a share of the whole distribution. I think it’s also good to add the shares of the other wealth percentile groups, I’d argue it always add in understanding the scales by adding the element of comparison.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The income comparison is solely my own interest though. And I’m doing something that I will criticize later in another post: I’m using the same y-axis for two related but also very different things. Income shares and wealth share can’t refer to the same absolute scale but are harmonized by the fact that they are standardized to a whole of 100%. I think it’s less misleading than in the other case I’m going to discuss, still it’s important to mention that the whole the proportion is referring to is something different for each indicator. Of course one shouldn’t forget the percentiles of the population probably overlap to some extent between income and wealth, but they are not the same and most definitely there are some changes over time of who’s in each group.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What I think Bharti does better in his paper than the World Inequality Database in this promotional graph is to include an indication of the actual datapoint. This indication helps to see which parts of the graph are interpolated and how often the indicator was measured. Especially when I’m adding the income indicator it’s very revealing to see how different the frequency of measurement is, which links back to the data gathering process: While income data is often available for every year, mainly because this data is collected to properly calculate taxes, wealth data has to be collected with surveys, millionaires lists or inferred from other data.
                    The lack of the data points in combination with the grid might also suggest the data might have been collected at the beginning of every decade, when it actually after every first or second year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I started to incorporate some interactivity in this visualization, which could and probably should be expanded by tooltips when hovering over the line to see the actual values. I understand that this would be highly unconventional in a paper, which almost always is asked to be submitted as a pdf, for the graph on the website this would have been a possibility, but it could also be too much for the original purpose.

                        It starts by showing a graph of a perfectly equal distribution, followed by a visualization of the ideal distribution according to <a href="http://www.people.hbs.edu/mnorton/norton%20ariely%20in%20press.pdf">a 2010 survey</a>. Ingraham then reveals the actual distribution. Starting by only showing quintiles and then breaking up the top quintile in smaller groups in the next  graph. I won’t redesign this whole sequence, but I wanted to see if there might be slight improvements to this last graph. Ingraham uses data from a working paper of Edward N. Wolff who introduces another measure for wealth which he calls “Financial Resources. In contrast to Net Worth, he excludes net equity in primary owner-occupied housing arguing that this measure is closer to “marketable wealth”, since it is more difficult to sell one’s own home in the short term.

                    In my re-design I experiment with re-arranging the population and wealth comparison, I juxtapose the pie icon with another visual metaphor and introduce a macro grouping. The proximity of the two graphs allowed me to compare two different ways of measuring wealth, in this special case, by the same author with the same data source.

                  <div class="editorial">
                    <p>
                      When rearranging the Ingraham’s graph I wanted the maximum icon count on every side of one row to be ten and I tried match every first row across both sides to immediately show abundance or scarcity. I decided not to round the shares of financial resources because the totals wouldn’t match to the -1.3% debt for the bottom 20% which is a rather important point in my opinion, which I wanted to highlight with the groupings that I introduced.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Looking at the Actual Pie Distribution for a while I started to question if the wealth that is measured here actually feels like the icing on the cake for all the groups across the distribution or if it is much more essential at least for the lower 40 maybe even 60% and if the pie metaphor is suggesting that it’s just pie and you still have the bread of your income to cover the essential needs. For my adaptation I decided to use a bread icon instead even though I’m aware it might not feel like the correct metaphor for the entire distribution either.
                      </p>
                      <p class='it'>
                        Side note: Since I’ve started researching on this topic, I’m getting different suggestions for articles like this one for example: <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/12/rich-people-happy-money/577231/">The Reason Many Ultrarich People Aren’t Satisfied With Their Wealth</a>. Wealth is very relative at every part of the distribution (except maybe for the very ends of it). I interpret this as a hint that net bread metaphor might feel adequate to its upper part as well.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                      I found it very interesting that Edward N. Wolff introduced another indicator to measure wealth and being new to the field I hadn’t expected that. I thought it that these measures were quite rigid in the field amongst researchers. I think different measures like that are really complimentary to each other and can highlight different aspects of distributions. The financial resources measure highlights the fact that a lot of the net worth of the lower groups in the distribution is due to owner-occupied homes and without taking this into the calculation of wealth the result is even more unequal.

                      Originally I found these two graphs in an <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldurkheimer/2018/03/01/0-001-percent-one-percent/#4b394a532cf2">Forbes</a> online article. I was happy to find them, because it offered the challenge of looking at inequality from a different perspective – progressive taxation. And I’m glad they made their way into my filter bubble. The first one seemed very interesting but also kind of confusing due to the color coding. I’m trying to make patterns more obvious with a new grouping and color coding.

                      I struggled with the proportions in the second graph and it took me almost two days to figure out why: The y-axis label are actually two labels, and even though the y-axis is readable and gives the correct numbers as a share of 100% and is correct in that sense, these 100% are related but completely different things. I don’t have the perfect answer to “solve” this visual problem yet, but I think I found a good way to visualize the problem.

I was also happy to find this dataset because it provided granularity even beyond the top 1%.

                  For both of these graphs I want to improve the access to the information and the understanding of the relation of the proportions. I also want to make my own process of reading transparent and illustrate my obstacles in making sense of the graphs and the data

                    I don’t know anything about the US tax legislation, except for what I learned by making these graphs. I’m not yet sure how representative the data is in regards to material inequality, but this was a good starting point for further research for me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was especially excited to find data on the top 0.001 % income group since it is really small and probably one of the few ways to gather data about it are billionaires lists and tax reports. In 2015 this group was formed by only 1412 people.

                    <p>
                      The first graph, visualizing average tax rates for different income groups, seemed more like just a design exercise first. Instead of relying on a strictly ordinal color scheme, which is understandable considering the fact that we are conveying data about very different groups, I still wanted to make subgroups that share a color hue and separate within these groups by lightness. Since they are also ranked, I also wanted to follow the ranking within a group but make clear cuts between groups because the IRS categorizes by different intervals or steps in magnitudes respectively and I wanted to reflect that. I sacrificed the feeling of overall linearity to have the highest contrast in hue in the top 10% range.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       It was a bit confusing that the “bottom” categories are just different shares of the top distribution combined with the bottom 50% and so I only included them in this graph, where they actually convey additional information. For the income & income tax shares it actually would have been interesting to see a more granular aggregation as well.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Due to the new colors the insights of Dungan’s graph are hopefully more easily accessible: The actual income tax rate follows a progression, every next group of income percentiles has a relatively higher income tax rate, until we get to the percentiles of the top one percentile, where the we can see a ne relation: while the top 0.1% have the highest tax rate, the top 0.01% group is below the rate of the top 2%. And the top 0.001% are close to the rate of the top 5% group. In the past this relationship was even more dramatic and the tax rate of the 0.001% was way below the top 10% group.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      What Dungan dramatizes in the domain of the y-axis, I probably overemphasize in the aspect ratio, trying to get enough legibility in the closer distances of the groups in the top 5 percent region, there is still some  over-plotting at the labels, but I found the direct positioning at the line important for a graph with that many labels.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I hope the direct positioning of the labels at the end of each line helps with another problem I’m facing, too: My color scheme is not really accessible in regards to color blindness and at least being able to trace the lines is not the nicest or best solution, but might help a little bit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Even though the aspect ratio is now having the effect that one might criticize the Dungan’s choice of domain for, I think the effect is a bit smaller in this one, with having the context of all other income groupings and also the zero at the start of the domain.

                      While it’s not completely wrong to put different measures on the same scale if they were standardized to shares of a whole, it also doesn’t feel 100 % correct either. I hope I was able to visualize my concern with that. In the future I would also explore an interactive and dynamic approach, where the user could toggle between these to states and see an animation of the difference. Interactivity might also help understanding better that these areas (and the underlying data) are stacked, which could also be revealed by hovering over them.

                      I think the original graph can be mis-interpreted and at first glance you might think for example that the top-earners paid twice as much taxes as their income and even after understanding the two different scales it is hard to set them in proportion mentally.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      On the other hand it is correct that relatively speaking the share of income taxes for the top earners is higher than their income share. And I acknowledge that you can argue that this is also a kind of inequality that one might even call unjust. The original graph can be effective in conveying this message, which might not support the view I have a bias for, but then offers the opportunity for debate about tax progressivity.

                    <p>
                      Because I’m using a timeline or a historical approach for both graphs, I had to be extra careful with the y-axis for the graph in the middle. I decided not to include ticks for it because they would change for every year, as the total of taxes paid changes. But combined with the dashed line I hope it actually highlights the character of the two different scales.

                      I’m not sure if it helps in understanding or is actually more confusing, maybe it’s not for me to tell because I’m not a native speaker, but I wanted to share this quote of the Forbes article that explained the relations and that I found peculiarly interesting:
                    </p>
                    <p class='my-quote'>
                       Imagine the top One Percent is represented by 1,000 people standing in a room. Of those 1,000 people, 100 people (the top 0.1% of all taxpayers), pay 19.5% of all taxes in the United States. So, of the 39% of all taxes paid by the top One Percent as a group, about 50% of that is paid by just one in ten of those people.
                       <br>
                       (…)
                       <br>
                       If we imagine that just one of those 1000 people represents the top 0.001% of all taxpayers, that single person pays 3.53% of all taxes paid in the U.S. — about 40% of the entire amount paid by the top 0.01%.

# Initial ideas

1. Left-wing punk rock in Germany. A subculture as a measure to mainstream political movements between 1976 and 2006. (Amount of concerts, published records, active bands, significant events)

2. The rise of post-structuralism in the 70s/80s. Analysis in numbers (publications, citations, professorships, google n-grams).

3. Making sense of lists posthumously. Continuation of my MFA diploma thesis [http://felixbuchholz.com/](http://felixbuchholz.com/). My grandma had been writing lists in the last years of her life. Rarely these are just groceries lists, often they look like auto-didactic study, circling around politics, history and health, I would like to work with these lists, digitalize them and try an analysis of word counts, word proximities and similar approaches.

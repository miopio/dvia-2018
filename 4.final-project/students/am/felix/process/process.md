# How to measure inequality

Doing more research on my subject, I realized that there are plenty of different dimensions and aspects to inequality than just income distribution and 90:10 percentile ratios.

The Stanford Center on Poverty & Inequality for example lists the following research groups.

- Consumption
- Discrimination & Poverty
- Education
- Family
- Health
- Housing
- Incarceration
- Income and Wealth
- Labor Markets
- Life Course
- Poverty
- Race, Ethnicity, and Immigration
- Safety Net
- Segregation
- Social Mobility

Some of those definitely overlap and I would try and think of more general categories and subcategories.   But inspired by the reading of Chapter two of Drucker’s Graphesis, I want to adjust the focus of my final project.

Instead of re-visualizing Piketty’s dataset for Capital in the 21st century I want to find ways to visualize the influence of various design and measurement choices on the result and how equal or unequal a observed situation / community / society appears. I would think that these choices are heavily guided by theoretical considerations about justice and political beliefs and intentions. I think this visualization could be successful if it provided some orientation and literacy to navigate this highly contested domain.

To achieve this goal I’m currently thinking of three different approaches:

1. Visualizing the decision & design process
2. Visualizing different outcomes in a small multiple approach, where one measurement or design choice is changed on every iteration.
3. Visualizing just the difference of the outcomes. Which is ver attractive in its abstraction, but currently I struggle to come up with a good visualization approach.

Currently I’m most interested in approach 1 and I can think of two sub sets of how to visualize the decision process. For both I want to use somehow famous or effective visualizations and analyze them. The first approach would be to show which options were chosen to realize the graph and which weren’t. The second approach would be to draw two or three alternative versions of the same visualization, hopefully with the same dataset and show if there would have been a more moderate or more dramatic way to visualize the data.

Education and Employment

Project goal: 
- Visualize trends in choosing major in postsecondary institution
- Visualize jobs' market value by major


Step 1: Find data
Data source:
- (US Bureau of Labour) Median Salary and Number of Jobs
- (UNESCO) Bachelor Degrees Conferred by Major


Step 2: Clean data
- Since there are a lot years missing in the Education Data set, I chose to use only year 2005 to 2016
- I only used the majors that I could group into different occupational group that the Employment dataset has. Those groups are:
	Business
	Agriculture
	Legal Studies and Professions
	Art, Design, Sport and Entertainment
	Math and Computer Science
	Education and Library
	Healthcare and Biology

Step 3: Sketch Data
Tool used: Google Sheet Chart, Illustrator

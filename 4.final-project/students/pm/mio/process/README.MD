### Initial Ideas

### Three Concepts

### Final Concept
Tackle human connection/empathy/intimacy in an increasingly isolating world, and how can we remedy that both through digital interface and also by harnessing digital interface to increase meaningful direct human interaction?

Going to use DBs from the world happiness report, machine learning studies, social tech labs as a concrete source for introductory visualization 

But then have my own questions that Iâ€™ll use both Amazon mechanical Turks and also target friend populations for surveys/interviews--thought it would be interesting if people who choose "human connection" as a career/way of life have different responses

And use that to create more of a storytelling visualization, use more human photos and experiences rather than just data-driven dots and numbers

### More Realistic Scope of Final Concept

### Process

### Critique 1
- Each region is a box plot --> each country is visualzied as a line within box plot
- Plot in descending order by region

### Critique 2
- look to see if there is tourism data (UN?)
- look to see if there is immigration/emigration data
- focus on the box plot
- interaction: maybe the box plots change with each parameter 
- info aesthetics class: it's ok to focus on just the box plot data
- try to look at recommendations from different regions(countries): are they different from the US?
- simple scatterplot: plot happiness value with number of times it was mentioned
- focus on the box plot--> make it something that can go on a wall (dont rely on hovers to tell you all the information)

### Critique 3
- take a look at suicide rates of countries and/or emigration data and/or net immigation
- order box plots by descending order using one of the variables, then keep order

### Initial Ideas

See /process/ideas.text and /process/datasources.txt

### Three Concepts

See /process/DVIA-2018 Final Project Proposals.pdf

### Final Concept
I chose to pursue Concept 3 further (Human Connection, Empathy, and Intimacy in the Digital Age). I wanted to tackle the ideas of human connection, empathy, intimacy in an increasingly isolating world, and how we remedy that both through digital interface and also by harnessing digital interface to increase meaningful direct human interaction.

My initial datasets included the World Happiness Report, which I wanted to use for a general overview of happiness of countries around the world, and what factors influenced this happiness. I extracted variables that they measured that related to human connection ("social support", "generosity", "freedomto make life choices") to break down the influences of happiness. I then intended on using a machine learning dataset called HappyDB, which included 100,000 responses from people who wrote strings on "what made them happy in the last 24 hours/last week", to see the rate at which words relating to humans and connections appeared in this dataset. Finally, I wanted to implement my own survey through both Amazon Mechanical Turks and in my own network to see if there were differences in perceived happiness and values that contribute to happiness between the general population and those with holistic careers, whose job you could say is to "understand humans" and "guide humans to live a better life".

See /process/wireframes for the general sketch.

### More Realistic Scope of Final Concept
Unfortunately, the above project was impossible to execute under the time constraints, and I had to put aside the bulk of it for this particular project. I was left with only the World Happiness Report, which I had only intended to use as an introduction. 

### Critique 1
- Each region is a box plot --> each country is visualzied as a line within box plot
- Plot in descending order by region

### Critique 2
- look to see if there is tourism data (UN?)
- look to see if there is immigration/emigration data
- focus on the box plot
- interaction: maybe the box plots change with each parameter 
- info aesthetics class: it's ok to focus on just the box plot data
- try to look at recommendations from different regions(countries): are they different from the US?
- simple scatterplot: plot happiness value with number of times it was mentioned
- focus on the box plot--> make it something that can go on a wall (dont rely on hovers to tell you all the information)

### Critique 3
- take a look at suicide rates of countries and/or emigration data and/or net immigation
- order box plots by descending order using one of the variables, then keep order

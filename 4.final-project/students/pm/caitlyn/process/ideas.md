### FINAL PROJECT IDEAS 11/6

1. My dad and relatives are all from England, so pubs are a quintessential part of my family's culture. Even though I usually like to start with a question, I came across this dataset of ever pub in england, and I really want to work with it. Instead of doing a map, which is what the instinct would be, I want to make a Markov chain pub name generator since the database has a field with all the names. While location insights could be interesing, I find the pub names one of the more unique aspects of this data. It would be fun to make some sort of visualization where the user would need to guess the real pub name versus the fake one.

question: what is the typical name of a pub in england?
insights: fun reflection of pub names
format: digital/interactive

2. My favorite band are known for their hardcore touring schedule, and it would be interesting to breakdown just how many dates they’ve played. With this one, I think I’ll cave to the instinct of making a map, but I can really get involved with Leaflet and make something eye-catching for this type of data. Adding in some of temporal aspect would be cool too, so I can see how their touring schedule has changed over time.

question: where have catfish and the bottlemen toured the most?
insights: a look into a recent band's intensive touring schedule
format: digital/interactive

3. It comes as no surprise that I thought about this one during my commute to work. The goal here would be to develop some kind of measure that would determine the best train line in the city and then visualize that explanation in some way.

question: what is the best train line in the new york city subway system?
insights: an analysis of trainlines planned a long time ago in terms of the city's modern landscape
format: print/static might be cool for this one because of its link to maps

4. I wrote my senior thesis in college on data visualization in journalism, and I opened it with a discussion of the London Underground map. I’d like to dive into the history of the Underground map and visualize it in with an interesting, data-driven timeline.

question: what is the evolution of the london underground map?
insights: a tour of how the london underground map has changed over time
format: for the same reasons as #4, i think print/static might work well here

5. My favorite band of all time is Green Day, but they were around a literal decade before I was even born, so there’s a lot of data to work with about them. I’m interested in doing an analysis and visualization of how their setlists have changed over time. I think timeline-style visualization would work well here.

question: how have green day's setlists changed over time?
insights: a deep-dive into this band's legendary live show and which songs have persisted throughout their almost 30-year career
format: digital/interactive

6. One of my co-workers just worked on a visual essay about the evolution of Jordan sneakers over time, and I’d like to do the same for the classic Adidas sneaker. Her piece was very art-driven, but I would need to configure a way to incorporate the brand’s imagery into a data-driven output.

question: how has classic adidas evolved?
insights: figure out how the shoe evolved with the brand over time
format: digital/interactive

7. As a case study for my senior thesis, I did a visualization on a band called the 1975. The one thing I didn’t dive into was their lyrics. Using some sort of rudimentary natural language processing, I’d to visualize the band’s lyrics across their first four EPs and two albums ahead of the release of their third album at the end of this month.

question: what do the 1975's lyrics look like?
insights: i haven't decided with technique i would use here just yet, but a deeper understanding of this band's complex and extensive discography
format: digital/static

8. I work out of the Google offices in Chelsea Market, but my badge can get me into any location in the world. I thought it would be intriguing to visualize the locations of Google offices with a non-traditional map format, revealing some insight of where the massive company has concentrations of employees and operations.

question: where are google offices located around the world?
insights: a look into where the company is concentrated globally
format: digital/static

9. I just finished watching The Crown on Netflix about the British Royal Family, and I'm interested in creating some sort of network visualization that acts as a family tree for the complexity 

question: what is the british royal family tree?
insights: an understanding of the complex connections of the british royal family
format: digital/interactive

10. While walking to my other class on Monday, I immediately turned on Spotify and got the idea to do a visualization of my listening history in 2018. Spotify does an end of the year recap, which I have always loved, but I think it would be cool to do my own take on it.

question: what has my listening history looked like in 2018?
insights: what artists/albums/songs/playlists have i listened to the most this year
format: digital/static

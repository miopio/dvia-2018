#### data process

1. Downloaded the lyrics of each song by the 1975 using the Genius API and Lyricist npm library (in `data.js`).

2. Manually cleaned songs 
- deleted irrelevant ones, i.e.â€”ones from their forthcoming album that don't have lyrics uploaded yet ("Anybody Willing To Listen"), instrumentals ("12"), and live songs ("A Change of Heart (Live From The O2, London)")
- in `thrown_out` and stored in `not used` folder

3. Python notebook for textual analysis (`textual-analysis.ipynb`)
- N-grams were computed first on the entire corpus of lyrics. The songs were then categorized by album, and n-grams were computed for each album of lyrics.
- I originally used an nltk n-gram library, but it tokenized the words wrong (in particular, it was separating "gonna" and "wanna" into two word, which show up frequently in the lyrics)
- but then I used this great n-gram tutorial instead to do it with Python and no external libraries: https://www.techcoil.com/blog/how-to-generate-n-grams-in-python-without-using-any-external-libraries/ 
- TF-IDF was computed again first on the entire corpus and then on each album individually.
- Shout out to this awesome TF-IDF tutorial: http://www.ultravioletanalytics.com/blog/tf-idf-basics-with-pandas-scikit-learn

4. Python notebook for audio analysis (`audio-analysis.ipynb`)
- For the audio analysis, I used the features included in Spotify's <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-several-audio-features/">API</a>.
- The available features are: danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo
- I first needed to create a CSV of all of the Spotify track IDs of each song (see `spotify-ids.csv`)
- I then hit the API for the audio features of each track with those IDs (see `audio-features.csv`).

5. Manually gathered popularity
- After a ton of research, I found out the only way to gather Spotify play counts for tracks is to manually use the desktop app and record for each song, which is what I did (see `popularity.csv`).

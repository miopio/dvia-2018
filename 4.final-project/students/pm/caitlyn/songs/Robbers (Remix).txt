Verse 1:
.... Such Amazing Eyes...
...... See; She-had, A-face; Like-An, Angel..
And, She-had, 'Love'; So, 'Painful'; It, -
-May; Just, Take-Their-Life! ...

She-Once; Was, 'Saved'-From; The, Rainfall..
... When-She; Found, Some-One; To, Make-Sure; She, 'Ain't' 'Fall' ..
-She; Fell-For, Her-Man; So-He, Held-Both, Her-Hands...
..... But nowdays; She, Don't; Even, Take-His Side...

............. He hates this....
He wants to make it right..........
He'll - do-what-it takes; to, -HEAL the pain inside her...
He'll - do-what-it takes...

Her balaclava's stained; And, Today-She's; ... -
-The one; With his gun; And, He's Begging 'Babe stay...........

Verse 2:
If you never shoot you'll never know...
& You'll only regret what you don't do...
Your Beauty's evil; Intelligence is lethal;
... Sometimes I feel like I don't know you..

Why, Do-I-Feel; Like, I-Owe-You? ...
It's a long way back.... And-I-know; You, -
-Know, if we don't get; back-up, when,-
-We've fallen; then, we won't move..

We're supposed to.. be partners in crime
But half of the time we're lunatics; Cah
Even though we both knew; -
-There's dark in the light; we were new to this..

.. Plus? ..... we, rushed...
Soon, I saw you enough; To, Think-That; -
-You-were, moooooving in!
And When She's leaving your home
She's begging you to stay.. stay.. stay... (But what use is it?)

Verse 3:
Well ... Now that you've got your gun;
You've got the leverage; But never would deliberately aim... So,-
-Tell me how; You, Gonna get away from what has come?
Intelligence is measured by ability to change....

He tells her he'll shoot; Do, Anything she asks of... But,-
-We-Need; To - Move; I can see police; They ain't the far off...
..... And believe me; B, We wouldn't last long...
& You'll see everythings gone wrong; if you just take your mask off....

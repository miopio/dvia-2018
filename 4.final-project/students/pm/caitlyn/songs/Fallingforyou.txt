[Verse 1]
What time you coming out?
We started losing light
I'll never make it right
If you don't want me 'round
I'm so excited for the night
All we need's my bike and your enormous house
You said someday we might
When I'm closer to your height
'Til then, we'll knock around and see
If you're all I need

[Hook]
Don't you see me? I
I think I'm falling, I'm falling for you
And don't you need me? I
I think I'm falling, I'm falling for you
On this night, and in this light
I think I'm falling (I think I'm falling), I'm falling for you
And maybe you, change your mind

[Verse 2]
I'm caught on your coat again
You said, "Oh no, it's fine"
I read between the lines and touched your leg again (again)
I'll take it one day at a time
Soon you will be mine, oh
But I want you now (I want you now)
When the smoke is in your eyes, you look so alive
Do you fancy sitting down with me? Maybe
'Cause you're all I need

[Bridge]
According to your heart
My place is not deliberate
Feeling of your arms
I don't want to be your friend
I want to kiss your neck

[Hook]
Don't you see me? I
I think I'm falling, I'm falling for you
And don't you need me? I
I think I'm falling, I'm falling for you
On this night, and in this light
I think I'm falling (I think I'm falling), I'm falling for you
And maybe you, change your mind

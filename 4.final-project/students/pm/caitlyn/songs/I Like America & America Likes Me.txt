[Intro]
I'm scared of dying
Is that on fire?
Am I a liar? Ooh
(I can't be quiet)
I'm scared of dying
No gun required, ooh
My skin is fire, so desired

[Verse 1]
Is that designer?
Is that on fire?
Am I a liar?
Oh, will this help me lay down?
My skin is fire, it’s so desired!
No gun required!
Oh, will this help me lay down?
I’m scared of dying, it’s fine
Oh, what’s a fiver?
Being young in the city
Believe, and say something

[Chorus]
Would you please listen!
Would you please listen!
We can see it's missing
When you bleed say so we know
Being young in the city
Believe, and say something

Would you please listen!
Would you please listen!
We can see it's missing
When you bleed say so, we know

[Verse 1]
Council, being listed
Man I kinda miss it, hey!
I’m a designer, unite pariahs
Am I a liar?
Oh, will this help me lay down?
Kids don’t want rifles, they want Supreme
No gun required!
Oh, will this help me lay down?
We're scared of dying, it's fine
What's a fiver?
Being young in the city
Believe, and say something

[Chorus]
Would you please listen?
Would you please listen?
We can see it's missing
When you bleed say so, we know
Being young in the city
Believe, and say something

[Bridge]
Don't have to say that
It's on fire
And where am I?
So let me, let me lie down
My skin is fire, it's so desired
No gun required
Oh, will it help me lay down?

[Outro]
I'm scared of dying
It's fine
Oh, what's a fiver?
Being young in in the city
Believe, and say something
And say something
And say something

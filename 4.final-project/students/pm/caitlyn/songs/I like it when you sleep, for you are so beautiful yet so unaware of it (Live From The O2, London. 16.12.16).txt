Welcome to the show, everyone. This is the biggest thing that we've ever done. We wanted to play some songs. For all the people that mean that we can be here this evening. So we're gonna go deep

[Verse]
Before you go, turn the big light off
(Please don't go) Before you go, turn the big light off
(Please don't go) Before you go, turn the big light off
(Please don't go) Before you go, turn the big light off

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
Early, early, monogamy, there isn't much

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Early, early
Early, early
Early, early, monogamy, there isn't much
Early, early, monogamy, there isn't much
Early, early, monogamy, there isn't much
Early, early, monogamy, there isn't much
Early, early, monogamy, there isn't much
Early, early, monogamy, there isn't much

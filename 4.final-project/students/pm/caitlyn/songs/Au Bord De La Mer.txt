In a zen-like state
I turn my car around in your drive
You've got a great apartment
It's such a shame we can't go inside

[Chorus]
And she said, "All the drinks are all on me"
And she said, "All the drinks are all on me"
And all and all and all and all and all
And all and all

Come back to my apartment
And don't be afraid of the ghosts
Tonight, baby girl, we'll have a party
And they'll just be invisible hosts
For you

[Chorus]

Grab your shoes
And your bag
And grab your coat

And then she just flew back home
And then she just flew back home
And then she just flew back home
And then
Well, she just flew back home
And then she just flew back home
Then she just flew back home

[Verse 1]
Straight lines, they unwind you
She does a little thing with her eyes that says, "We're off soon"
She says the bleeding's incidental cause she's so cool
She said, "I'm no fun if I've only a bottle of wine"

[Chorus]
And now she's doing it all the time
Yeah, she's doing it all the time

[Verse 2]
Slow down, yeah I want you
She does a little bit on the sly that shows what she's up to
She started talking about missing him, she was glistening
It won't mend your heart if it's only a couple of lines

[Chorus]
And now she's doing it all the time
Yeah, she's doing it all the time
Yeah, she's doing it all the time
Yeah, she's doing it all the time
Yeah, she's doing it all the time

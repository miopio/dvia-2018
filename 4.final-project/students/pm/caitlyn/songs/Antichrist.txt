[Verse 1]
And I swear there's a ghost on this island
And his hands, all covered in blood
And my wife inquired of understanding
But of course, my dear, you can't

She said, "How can I relate to somebody who doesn't speak?
I feel like I'm just treading water"

[Chorus]
Is it the same for you?
Is it the same for you?

[Verse 2]
Well he comes and he goes, so capricious
And his work appears so rushed
Well I love the house that we live in
And I love you all too much

[Chorus]
Is it the same for you?
Is it the same for you?
Is it the same for you?
Is it the same for you?

Well the criminals and liars
Keep them in your cells as a privilege of mine
And I love the house that we live in
And I love you all too much

[Bridge]
The blood is on your tongue as well as your hands
The blood is on your tongue as well as your hands

[Break]
The blood is on your tongue as well as your hands
Archaic and content you just wash them off
The blood is on your tongue as well as your hands
Archaic and content you just wash them off
The blood is on your tongue as well as your hands
Archaic and content you just wash them off
The blood is on your tongue as well as your hands
Archaic and content you just wash them off
The blood is on your tongue as well as your hands
Archaic and content you just wash them off
The blood is on your tongue as well as your hands
Archaic and content you just wash them off

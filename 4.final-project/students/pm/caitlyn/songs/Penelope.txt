And it started when he was leaning on your car
He said please leave if you’re uncomfortable
And he said here’s the way it goes
But he cries at dashboard shows
And he’s making me uncomfortable
Let's fuck him up and hit the road

If I search I’ll find you
Yeah maybe through hide and seek
I’ll find you

And that's only if I'm pushing it too far 'cause I couldn’t bear to see you uncomfortable
Now the fun has gone away let it snow on Christmas Day
And I don’t care if you don’t believe me telling you your new boyfriend’s gay

And if I search I’ll find you
Yeah maybe through hide and seek
I'll find you
And if I search I’ll find you
Yeah maybe through hide and seek
I'll find you
And if I search I’ll find you
Yeah maybe through hide and seek
I'll find you

Yeah if I search I’ll find you
And if I search I’ll find you (I’ll find you)
And if I search I’ll find you

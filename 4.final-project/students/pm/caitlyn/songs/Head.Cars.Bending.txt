[Verse 1]
Keep your voice down
And stop looking at my friends
Blow out
They can hear exactly what you say

[Pre-Chorus]
Drink, fall, spew
Telephone you
If you're alone in your room
What's that boy doing?

[Chorus]
Head, cars, bending
Head, cars, bending

[Verse 2]
Can we go now?
Not staying 'til the end
Fall down
Write another song about your friends
Locking me in, knocking me out
Talking like you do
And if you think you're helping me
I don't think I'm helping you

[Pre-Chorus]
Drink, fall, spew
Telephone you
If you're alone in your room
What's that boy doing?

[Chorus]
Head, cars, bending
Head, cars, bending
Head, cars, bending
Head, cars, bending

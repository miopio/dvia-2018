[Chorus]
Why do you talk so loud?
Why do you talk so?
Why do you talk so loud?
Why do you talk so?

[Verse 1]
Passing grammatical mistakes
Totally wrecked and polemic in the way he talks
Vocal sabbatical, delayed by churning out the same

[Chorus]
Why do you talk so loud?
Why do you talk so?
Why do you talk so loud?
Why do you talk so?

[Verse 2]
We don't got alarms we just use my dad's arms
Excess until we stop hearts
'I think you're trying too hard with your lungs in tar
And your kitchen full of pop stars'

[Verse 3]
And I've been thinking lots about your mouth
A conversation superseded by the way he talks
I'd be an anchor but I'm scared you'd drown
It's safer on the ground

[Chorus]
Why do you talk so loud?
Why do you talk so?
Why do you talk so loud?
Why do you talk so?

[Verse 1]
Passing grammatical mistakes
Totally wrecked and polemic in the way he talks
Vocal sabbatical, delayed by churning out the same

[Outro]
Why do you talk so loud?
(Cause I've been thinking lots about you)
Why do you talk so?
(Conversations ain't processed by the way you talk)
Why do you talk so loud?
(And I've been thinking lots about you)
Why do you talk so?

[Verse 1]
The skin that you're in is all soft now
And your bones are dry as ice
What you sitting 'round here for, and why you sad?
Cause everybody's pushing out babies now

[Interlude]
In the mornings, I was getting high with you
In the mornings, I was getting high with you

[Hook]
Cause everybody's pushing
(What you sitting 'round here for, and why is that?)
Cause everybody is pushing
Cause everybody is pushing

[Outro]
Well I thought I'd see you around but you're dead now, dead now
Well I thought I'd see you around but you're dead now, dead now, dead now
Well I thought I'd see you around but you're dead now, dead now
Well I thought I'd see you around but you're dead now, dead now, dead now
Well I thought I'd see you around but you're dead now
Well I thought I'd see you around but you're dead now
Well I thought I'd see you around but you're dead now
Well I thought I'd see you around but you're dead now

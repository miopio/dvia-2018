[Verse 1]
I'm sorry that your dad is dead
I hope you amend it
I think I've lost a lot of my friends
Through belief that I'm an instrument
Well fuck me if you must then
Treat me like an old friend
I can't exist within my own head
So I insist on haunting your bed
If you could only hear what I said
You'd see

[Hook]
I'm not scared (anymore no)
I'm not scared
I'm not scared
I'm not scared
I'm not scared
I'm not scared

[Verse 2]
Spin car round push your head down down down
And smash into the ground with you
There's been a piece of glass found and a terrible sound
What if what they're saying is true
Oh I prefer it in your bed; television set

[Hook]
I'm not scared
I'm not scared
I'm not scared
I'm not scared
I'm not scared
I'm not scared

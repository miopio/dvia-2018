(00:14 - 00:27)
As the Matty sits on the bed with his girl he reflects back over the things that have happened while getting interrupted by a thought of  the heist, suggesting these future ideas are now in planning.



Scene 3: Swimming Pool
00:00 - 00:00
Reflecting over the time spent well we see the fire in them around their friends growing with this drug induced state; the love flows  however when these highs run out things can start to go down hill.



Scene 4: The House
00:00 - 00:00
Representing the new start of their love, an investment a place where the truth really comes out where they can share both their highs and lows. It becomes interesting as over time we see this initial love slowly fading, but there is still an underlining obsession they have.

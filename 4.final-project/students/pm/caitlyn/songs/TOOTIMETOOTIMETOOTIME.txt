[Pre-Chorus]
You wet my eyes
But I don't mind it
I tell you lies
But it's only sometimes
You pick a fight
And I'll define it

[Chorus]
I swear that I (Swear that I)
I only called her one time
Maybe it was two times?
I don't think it was three times
It can't be more than four times
I think we need to rewind
You text that boy sometimes
Must be more than three times
I didn't mean to two-time you

[Verse]
She said that I should have liked it
I told her "I only use it sometimes"
Except when I need reminding
I'm petrified

[Chorus]
But I only called her one time
Maybe it was two times?
I don't think it was three times
I didn't mean to two-time, two-time you

[Pre-Chorus]
You wet my eyes
But I don't mind it
I tell you lies
But it's only sometimes
You pick a fight
And I'll define it

[Chorus]
I swear that
I only called her one time
Maybe it was two times?
I don't think it was three times
It can't be more than four times
I think we need to rewind
You text that boy sometimes
Must be more than three times
I didn't mean to two-time you, two-time you
To two-time, two-time you

[Chorus]
I only called her one time
Maybe it was two times?
I don't think it was three times
It can't be more than four times
I think we need to rewind
You text that boy sometimes
Must be more than three times
I didn't mean to two-time, two-time you

[Outro]
(One time, oh, one time, three time, four time
Three time, four time, two time, three time)
Two-time, two-time you
(One time, oh, one time, three time, four time
Three time, four time, two time, three time)

[Hook]
Yeah so far, It's alright, alright, baby
Yeah so far, It's alright, alright, baby
Yeah so far, It's alright, alright, baby
Yeah so far, It's alright, alright

[Verse 1]
Yeah it's the way we are
We were smoking by 11 and knocking round town
Beat 'em ups on my arm
We were never good at selling, couldn't cut down
And I stay with my father while his friends die of heart attacks
He's got a heart made of stone but he never gets cold because the sun's always on his back
"I used to think you were cool and I believed you had a wonderful vision
But I soon found out you're a terrible friend and your mother's on the television"
Give's a go on your bike, how you getting along with your life?
It's alright
Yeah it's alright

[Hook]
Yeah so far, It's alright, alright, baby
Yeah so far, It's alright, alright, baby
Yeah so far, It's alright, alright, baby
Yeah so far, It's alright, alright

[Verse 2]
"Well I'm coming to the end of 23," she said, "is that alright?"
"Well, it's coming to the end of you and me," she said, "is that alright?"
And how can you complain about life and talk about being bored?
If you just sit at Pete's house playing video games, doing sniff that you can't afford
I can't be picking up in the town
So get me one off Adam if he's sorting you out
I don't really care what all your friends were about
I was always looking for a way to get out
It's just a reflection on the size of your house
A silver spoon and a zoot in your mouth
But you're alright
Yeah it's alright

[Hook]
Yeah so far, It's alright, alright, baby
Yeah so far, It's alright, alright, baby
Yeah so far, It's alright, alright, baby
Yeah so far, It's alright, alright

[Verse 3]
So here we are, it's quarter to 11, we're knocking round town
Pushing in, in the bar, you can cry until 11, it's a quarter of an hour
And why stay if you hate it so much?
You think you're well cool
You just write about sex and killing yourself and how you hardly ever went to school
Don't you want to take me up in the clouds?
Pretend that I'm the one and you can show me about
She was talking marriage so we had to get out
Now he's making up for it by sleeping about
Your ultimatum's a ridiculous joke
I'm gonna pick that option that allows me to smoke
But I'm alright
Yeah it's alright

[Hook]
Yeah so far, It's alright, alright, baby
Yeah so far, It's alright, alright, baby
Yeah so far, It's alright, alright, baby
Yeah so far, It's alright, alright

Welcome, welcome boys and girls into a more distracted world – comprised of all the things you knew but older now (that's me and you) –the things inside post – 'don't you mind' reflect upon a recent time – where you and I were both online and part of a collective mind And still are we online you see but with much more consultancy – In groups we search ironically to find our self identity, embracing femininity, skeptics of affinity – maybe neither actually – deleting all civility – and fearing most proximity – but that has happened 'obviously' if you look retrospectively – but that's my point – that hindsight there – it's captured our collective stare a constant daze at bygone days seduced by programmed time delays – inside our phones our need has grown for inside there we're not alone – you see it's not all doom and gloom, just sanctify outside your room – it's easy when you're made aware, a more authentic captured stare – and something else to celebrate the fact that we can stay up late and share and care and make aware, some stranger who is over there – and change and mould and right some wrongs whilst streaming all our favourite songs – the left and right grow more apart but you can just click 'add to cart'.

[Verse 1]
I find it hard to say bye
Even in the state of you and I
And how could I refuse?
Yeah you rid me of the blues
Ever since you came into my life

[Chorus]
Because you're my medicine
(Yeah, you're medicine)
Yeah, you're my medicine
(Yeah, you're medicine)
(Yeah, you're medicine)

[Verse 2]
I, I wanna marry you
I say, "I, I adore you"
And that's all I have to say, "bye-bye"
And you opiate this hazy head of mine

[Chorus]
Because you're my medicine
(Yeah, you're medicine)
Yeah, you're my medicine
(Yeah, you're medicine)
(Yeah, you're medicine)

Because you're my medicine
(Yeah, you're medicine)
Yeah, you're my medicine
(Yeah, you're medicine)
Yeah, you're my medicine

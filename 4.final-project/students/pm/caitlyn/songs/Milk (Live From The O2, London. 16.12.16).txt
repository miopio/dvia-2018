Straight lines, they unwind you
She does a little thing with her eyes that says, "We're off soon"
She says the bleeding's incidental 'cause she's so cool
She said, "I'm no fun if I've only a bottle of wine"

[Chorus]
And now she's doing it all the time
Yeah, she's doing it all the time

Yeah, slow down, yeah, I want you
She does a little bit on the sly that shows what she's up to
Oh, she starts talking about missing him, she was glistening
It won't mend your heart if it's only a couple of lines

And now she's doing it all the time
Yeah, she's doing it all the time
Yeah, she's doing it all the time
Yeah, she's doing it all the time
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, do it!

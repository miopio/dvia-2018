*DISCLAIMER: This song was written by the band currently known as The 1975 when they went by the name BIGSLEEP. I'm publishing the lyrics here so that we don't have to make a million separate artist pages for the previous names The 1975 has taken on over the years. Thanks :)

You, you always seem to get what you want
You, you always seem to get better
And I'm dreaming, you're bleeding, depleted
And I'm bouncing off the floor and your ceiling
This feeling, guess the meaning
You know, you know, you seem to get better

And I still lie outside

Well this car moves faster than I'm ever gonna find you
Well this car moves faster than I'm ever gonna find you

So go take a little bit if you want
If you want to go and take a little bit if you want to
You're bleeding, depleted, guess the meaning
You know, you know, you seem to get better
I, I I'm the prince of the Tyne
Guess you wouldn't know cause you sleep on your side
I guess you wouldn't know, I guess you wouldn't know
You seem to get better

[x8]
Well this car moves faster than I'm ever gonna find you

Your days are switched
And I’m so impressed because
It looks like you dressed yourself today
Said when you go to join
If you keep this up
Then you’ll be the spitting image of your old man in no time

Go on, go on your way
And I will push you into the lake
Said focus all your rage I guess
Before I push you

Your mum and dad
Well they found it hard to be
Surprisingly different with me
In charge you’re like grabbing a feel
I'll fucking kill him if he touches you

Said focus all your rage
Along before I push you into the lake
Yes focus all your rage
Along before I push you

You're always delighted
At what was the same
Yeah you should've never been one
'Cos I've never been more proud of you like

Well I said think quick ‘cos it’s pissing it down
The flat and the rock as well they’ve all found out
A nice idea
It was a nice idea and I said
You can hold my hand or just walk away

Well I’m looking at you
And I’ve been looking straight at you and I’m
Here to say I’m right fucked off with you
'Cos you said that we could have
And Golden Gun is on but I’m being Oddjob

Are you coming back home soon
Coming back home soon
Coming back home
Any time soon

Well think quick cos it’s pissing it down
I wanna be soaked to the skin before we work this out
It was a nice idea
It was a nice idea and I said
You can hold my hand or you can walk away

Well I’m looking at you
Well I’ve been looking straight at you but I’m
Compelled to say I’m right fucked off with you
Cos you said that we could have
And Golden Gun is on but I’m being Oddjob

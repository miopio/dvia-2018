[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
One! Two! One, two three, go!

[Verse 1]
Rushing in a small town
I forgot to call you
Running low on know how
This beat I made for two

[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause I remember that I like you
No matter what I found
She said, "It's nice to have your friends 'round
We're watching the television with no sound"

[Chorus: Matthew Healy + *audience*]
It's just you and I, tonight
*Why don't you figure my heart out?*
It's just you and I, tonight
Why don't you figure my heart out?

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
Oh my god, like...

[Verse 2]
Push your lack of chest out
"Look at my hair!"
Gotta love the way you love yourself
"Your obsession with rocks and brown
And fucking the whole town is a reflection of your mental health"

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause I remember when I found you
Much younger than you are now
And once we started having friends 'round
You created a television of your mouth

[Chorus: Matthew Healy + *audience*]
It's just you and I, tonight
*Why don't you figure my heart out?*
It's just you and I, tonight
Why don't you figure my heart out?

[Bridge]
You got something to say?
Why don't you speak it out loud, instead of living in your head?
It's always the same
Why don't you take your heart out, instead of living in your head?

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
Ah yeah, now we're going London

[Saxophone solo]

[Chorus]
It's just you and I, tonight
Why don't you figure my heart out?
It's just you and I, tonight
Why don't you figure my heart out?
Alright
Why don't you figure out....

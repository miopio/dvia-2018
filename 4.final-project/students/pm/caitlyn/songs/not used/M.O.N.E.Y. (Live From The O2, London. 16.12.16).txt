[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
Aight, let's take it back

[Instrumental]

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
Ok, we're going now, we're going now, we're going back

How are you feeling on this side? How are you feeling on this side?

Everybody, let's play it here, one, two....

[Chorus]
Drink slow to feed the nose, you know he likes to get blown
Has he got enough money to spend?
Leave? No, he's to and 'fro, he doesn't like it when the girls go
Has he got enough money to spend?

[Verse 1]
It's going off 'cos they're not gonna let him in
2 and a half, the boy is rushing out his skin
He's got his charm with the girls that are smoking
He takes her arm, jumps the bar and now he's in

[Chorus]
Drink slow to feed the nose, you know he likes to get blown
Has he got enough money to spend?
Leave? No, he's to and 'fro, he doesn't like it when the girls go
Has he got enough money to spend?

[Verse 2]
A broken half, a glass has opened up his chin
He thinks he's hard, a powdered mouth that tastes of gin
He's just been barred for that blues he was smoking
And then he barks, 'It's my car I'm sleeping in'

[Bridge: Matthew Healy + audience]
Tabs with unlimited O's
New clothes, bloody nose
Powders and walking back home
Has he got enough weed?
No, broken phone
Retching on the floor alone
I can't believe that we're talking about him

[Verse 3]
'I'm searching you mate, your jaw's all over the place'
Can't talk, quick slap in the face
Yes, I threw a nut, but your friend's a case
Why you singling him out, is it because of his race?
'Look, the dog won't bark if you don't lark about'

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
I see it....
Hey, how's it going there?

[Outro]
M-O-N-E-Y's me
M-O-N-E-Y
M-O-N-E-Y's me
M-O-N-E-Y
M-O-N-E –
M-O-N-E –
M-O-N-E-Y
M-O-N-E-Y's me
M-O-N-E-Y

[Instrumental]

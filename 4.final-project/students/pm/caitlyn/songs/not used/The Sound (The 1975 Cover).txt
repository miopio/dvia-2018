[Intro]
Yeah, I know when you're around
Cause I know the sound, I know the sound of your heart
Yeah, I know when you're around
Cause I know the sound, I know the sound of your heart

[Verse 1]
Can't believe you forgot my name
Oh babe, I made you cum again
He said, "I've got a problem with your shoes
And your tunes, but I might move in
And I thought that you were straight, now I'm wonderin'"

Oh and you say I'm such a cliche
I can't see the difference in it anyway
And we left things to protect my mental health
But I'll call you when you're bored or you're playing with yourself

[Pre-Chorus]
You're so conceited, I said "I don't love you"
What does it matter if I lie to you?
I don't regret it, but I'm glad that we're through
So don't you tell me that you just don't get it
Cause I know you do

[Chorus]
Know when you're around
Cause I know the sound, I know the sound of your heart
Yeah, I know when you're around
Cause I know the sound, I know the sound of your heart

[Verse 2]
It's not about reciprocation, it's just all about me
I'm sympathetic, poetic, dramatic, but I wanna be
And there's so much skin to see
A simple Epicurean philosophy

[Pre-Chorus]
You're so conceited, you said you don't love me
What does it matter if you lie to me?
And I don't regret it, but I still can't sleep
So don't you tell me that you're sorry
Cause I know you did it purposely

[Chorus]
Know when you're around
Cause I know the sound, I know the sound of your heart
Yeah, I know when you're around
Cause I know the sound, I know the sound of your heart

[Bridge]
And I feel your heart beat to the beat of the drums
Oh what a shame that you came here with someone
So while you're here in my arms
Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young
We're gonna die young

I feel your heartbeat
Cause I know the sound, I know the sound of your heart
I feel your heartbeat
Cause I know the sound, I know the sound of your heart

[Hook]
Yeah, I know when you're around
Cause I know the sound, I know the sound
Yeah, I know when you're around
Cause I know the sound, I know the sound

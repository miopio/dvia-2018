[Verse 1]
Game face, getting why so serious, child
You're like a boy, delirious
When you say, "Is this town worth living in, living in?"
Is this town worth living in?

Cos all the girls and boys in the city, well
Just care about things like, "How does my hair look?" (very nice, very nice)
Saying, "How does my hair look?" (very nice)

[Hook]
Because we’re oh so scared of you
We’re oh so scared of you
We’re oh so scared of you

[Verse 2]
Do you remember when we spotted him? All suited and booted
She said you’re living in a cellophane house, you're never leaving
You're living in a cellophane house, you're never leaving

She said, "Use your fangs and my spare time
Come on in the car you'll have a great time"
You say, "is this town worth living in, living in?"
Is this town worth living in?

[Hook]
Because we’re oh so scared of you
We’re oh so scared of you
We’re oh so scared of you

[Breakdown]
Because you’re living in a cellophane house you're never leaving
Living in a cellophane house you're never leaving
Well you’re, you’re in a cellophane house you're never leaving
Living in a cellophane house you're never leaving

[Hook]
Because we’re oh so scared of you
We’re oh so scared of you
We’re oh so scared of you
Because we’re oh so scared of you
We’re oh so scared of you
We’re oh so scared of you

[Breakdown] [2x]
Because you’re living in a cellophane house you're never leaving
Living in a cellophane house you're never leaving
Well you’re, you’re in a cellophane house you're never leaving
Living in a cellophane house you're never leaving

We'll storm the walls
We'll storm the walls of this town
We're taking out
We're taking over all your shops
And all your sons and daughters

And we'll watch you
Running
And you'll feel the wrath of my sword
And, well so long
To your brother
I never liked him anyway

Let's take a walk
Let's take a walk
Right, new town

You find yourself lost
You pass the steps
But use the breadcrumb trails
What Hansel and Gretel left

And we'll watch you
Running
Playmobils and building blocks
Won't distract you from your lego, lego

Top of the wall
Shouting
(EYO EYO)
You're over the top
Because
The lights are on in Bordello, -dello, -dello, -dello

And we eventually gave up
We’ll eventually gave up, who you?
We eventually, that’s who
Know what this means!
This means war!
Hey, do you know me?
Watching you stand, out, oh
Oh!

And we're not frightened, not at all
And we're not frightened, not at all
And we're not frightened not at all

And we are
We are kings
We are kings
We are kings

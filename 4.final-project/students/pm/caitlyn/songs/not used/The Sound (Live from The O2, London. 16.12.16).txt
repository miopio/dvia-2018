[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
London, thank you so much for making this such an incredible, special evening for us. We've only just fucking started!

[Intro: Choir + Matthew Healy]
Well, I know when you're around cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart (We'll see you next year.)
Let's go! One, two!

[Chorus: Matthew Healy + choir and audience]
Well, I know when you're around cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
You sing it!

Well, I know when you're around cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart

[Verse 1]
I can't believe I forgot your name
Oh baby, won't you cum again?
She said "I've got a problem with your shoes
And your tunes, but I might move in
And I thought that you were straight, now I'm wondering"
Let's go!

[Pre-Chorus: Choir + Audience]
You're so conceited, I said "I love you"
What does it matter if I lie to you?
I don't regret it but I'm glad that we're through
So don't you tell me that you "just don't get it"

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
London!

Cause I know you do

[Chorus]
Well, I know when you're around cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart
Well, I know when you're around cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart

[Verse 2]
It's not about reciprocation, it's just all about me
A sycophantic, prophetic, Socratic junkie wannabe
There's so much skin to see
A simple Epicurean philosophy
And you say I'm such a clich√©
I can't see the difference in it either way
And we left things to protect my mental health
But you'll call me when you're bored and you're playing with yourself

[Pre-Chorus]
You're so conceited, I said "I love you"
What does it matter if I lie to you?
I don't regret it but I'm glad that we're through
So don't you tell me that you just don't get it

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
London, one more time! Let's go!

Cause I know you

[Chorus]
Well, I know when you're around cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart
Well, I know when you're around cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart
Well, I know when you're around cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart
Well, I know when you're around cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
London, one last time

If you're on the floor, if you're in heaven, if you're on the side, it doesn't matter. I need everyone to jump up and down and count to four

One! One, two, fucking jump!

[Guitar solo: Adam Hann]

[Spoken: Matthew Healy + audience]
One! Two! One, two, three!

Hey London, let's go!

[Chorus]
Well, I know when you're around cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart
Well, I know when you're around cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
London!

Well, I know when you're around cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
One more time!

Well, I know when you're around cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
Good night!

[Speech]
I'm not here to talk about politics, we're not here to think about politics. We're here for a release, we're here for some music, a release from all the bullshit
*Someone shouts "fuck Donald Trump*
Ah, but that's the thing, it's not even really about fuck Donald Trump, that's the thing. It's not even that..

We've been in America for like, three months during the election and we were in the UK during Brexit so we fucking picked our time in this year. But that's not, that's kind of not the rhetoric that's needed cause I was so angry and I know, look at- We see loads of young, liberal, compassionate people every night so this is like our world, this is the world that we see. So when things go at odds of that, it's really confusing and it's really fucking- It makes you really angry and the thing is, I know it's very sad to see all of these young voices of progression and change being drowned out by regressive ideals and bullshit. It's very sad. And it appears to be paradigms of race and it is about that, and it is about gender, and it is about age, and it is about sexuality, but it's also about a lot of these people that voted against for what we stand for

They feel so so disenfranchised by both sides of political systems that that felt like the right thing to do. So if we're young, right? And we're liberal, and we're compassionate, and we're Muslim and we're black, and we're gay, and we're whatever. If we are that then it's our responsibility to be compassionate, to listen to everybody, listen to their concerns and move things forward. And you are our people and we love you so fucking much, you have no idea. This song's about loving someone..

[Chorus]
You should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be..

[Verse 1]
My heart is telling me the telly isn't telling me anything
I need but it needs to keep selling me
Beside celebrities lacking in integrity
Holding up the status quo instead of showing the kids
That they matter, who are they gonna batter next?
Just keep hold of their necks and keep selling them sex
It’s better if we keep them perplexed
It's better if we make them want the opposite sex
Disenfranchised young criminal minds in a car park beside where your nan resides are not slow
They’ve just never been shown that you should be..

[Chorus]
Loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be..

[Verse 2]
We're all human, we're just like you man
We’re sentient or something or other I can’t remember, whatever
We shouldn't have people afloat
If it was safer on the ground, we wouldn't be on a boat
Charlatan telepathy exploiting insecurity and praying on the purity
Of grief and its simplicity but I know that maybe I'm too skeptical
Even Guy Debord needed spectacles, you see
I'm the Greek economy of cashing intellectual cheques
And I'm trying to progress, but instead of selling sex..
I think I should be..

[Chorus]
Loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be..

[Interlude: Spoken Word]
I am forever in alongside the boys in jumpers
On bikes from schools and cars
With autumn leaves fallen sparse across the mid-afternoon
She blazed about how ‘Cultural language is an operating system
A simple interface rendered feeble and listless
When tested with divinity or a true understanding of the human condition
I never did understand – the duality of art and reality – living life and treating it as such but with a certain disconnect to touch that cajoles at the artist with comfort and abandon
And between the rolling roofs and spires of the white city
That orange, English light cast only one, singular shadow
For you are not beside but within me

[Chorus]
Loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Oh, oh..

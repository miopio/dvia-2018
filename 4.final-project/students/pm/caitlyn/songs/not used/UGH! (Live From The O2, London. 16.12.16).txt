[Instrumental]

[Verse 1: Matthew Healy + audience]
Hey boy, stop pacing 'round the room
Using other people's faces as a mirror for you
I know your lungs need filling
Since your gums have lost their feeling
But don't say that you're giving it up again
"Do you have a card?
My irregular heart beat is starting to correct itself," baby
Oh, it's just a simple diuretic that prevents the empathetic
From being just and giving it up

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
You sing it

[Chorus: Matthew Healy + audience]
And you're the only thing that's going on in my mind
Taking over my life a second time
I don't have the capacity for fucking
You're meant to be helping me
When I said I liked it better without my money, I lied
It took a little while to recognize
That I, I'm not giving it up again

[Verse 2]
This conversation's not about reciprocation no more
But I'm gon' wait until you finish so I can talk some more
About me and my things, my car, my living
And how I'm giving it up, giving it up again

[Chorus]
And you're the only thing that's going on in my mind
Taking over my life a second time
I don't have the capacity for fucking
You're meant to be helping me
When I said I liked it better without my money, I lied
It took a little while to recognize
That I, I'm not giving it up again

[Bridge]
The kick won't last for long
But the song only lasts 3 minutes
I think I've lost my phone
So won't you call it up for me?
The kick won't last for long
But the song only lasts 3 minutes
And I know it's wrong
But give me one

[Chorus]
And you're the only thing that's going on in my mind
Taking over my life a second time
I don't have the capacity for fucking
You're meant to be helping me
When I said I liked it better without my money, I lied
It took a little while to recognize
That I, I'm not giving it up again (ohh-oh-ohh)

[Outro]
I'm not giving it up
Oh, I'm not giving it up, hey!
Oh, I'm not giving it up
I'm not giving it up, ohh-ohhh
Oh, I'm not giving it up, oh yeah (Giving it up)
I'm not giving it up, giving it up

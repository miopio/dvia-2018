And I'm so bored of this
Of how your opinions changed on that Knuckles is pink
So I lay in what you've made
My opinion changed but my outlook stayed the same

Focus if you want to be
Anything in front of me
The only problem is you say that Tails is obviously gay
And I can't find a reason to do exactly what you wanna do
So I'll just pretend that we're just friends again

And how your opinions changed on that Knuckles is pink
So I lay in what you've made
My opinion changed but my outlook stayed the same

Focus if you want to be
Anyone you wanna be
The only problem is you say is that you look just like Penelope
And I can't find a reason to do exactly what you wanna do
So I'll just pretend that we're still friends again

Of how your opinions changed on that Knuckles is pink
So I lay in what you've made
My opinion changed, my outlook stayed the same

Well I found your gate and I took the lock down
Oh, I found your room and I tried your clothes on
I found the kitchen so I put some food on
I found a match and I burned down your house

I found your mum and I tore her dress down
I found your dad and I turned his car on
I found your dolls and I tore their heads off
I found a match and I burned down your house

And I'm so bored of this
How my opinions changed on that Knuckles is pink
So I lay in what you've made
My opinions changed but my outlook stayed the same

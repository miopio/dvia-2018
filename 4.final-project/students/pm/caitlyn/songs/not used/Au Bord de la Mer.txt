[Verse 1]
In a zen like state
I turn my car around in your drive
You've got a great apartment
It's such a shame we can't go inside

[Chorus]
And she said;
"All the drinks are all on me"
And she said;
"All the drinks are all on me"
And all, and all, and all, and all, and all, and all, and all

[Verse 2]
Come back to my apartment
And don't be afraid of the ghost
Tonight baby girl we'll have a party
And they'll just be invisible hosts for you

[Chorus]
And she said;
"All the drinks are all on me"
And she said;
"All the drinks are all on me"
And all, and all, and all, and all, and all, and all, and all

[Bridge]
Grab your shoes
And your bag
Grab a coat
We're home

[Interlude]

And then she just flew back home
Then she just flew back home
And then she just flew back home
And then, and then
And she just flew back home
Then she just flew back home

[Verse 1]
Thought I'd end up with Sean
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh
Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel

[Pre-Chorus]
One taught me love
One taught me patience
One taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
Look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say

[Chorus]
Thank you, next (ooh)
I'm so grateful for my-
Thank you, next (ooh)
I'm so grateful for my-

[Verse 2]
Spend more time with my friends
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Plus, I met someone else
We havin' better discussions
I know they say I move on too fast
But this one gon' last
'Cause her name is Ari
And I'm so good with that

[Pre-Chorus]
She taught me love
She taught me patience
She handles pain
That shit's amazing
I've loved and I've lost
That's not what I see
Look what I found
Ain't no need for searching, and for that, I say

[Chorus]
Thank you, next (ooh)
I'm so grateful for my-
Thank you, next (ooh)
I'm so grateful for-

[Bridge]
One day I'll walk down the aisle
Holding hands with my mama
I'll be thanking my dad
'Cause she grew from the drama
Only wanna do it once, real bad
Forbid something happens
Least this song is a smash

[Pre-Chorus]
Love
Got so much patience
Learned from my pain
And I turned out amazing (Turned out amazing)
I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
Look what I've found (hey)
Ain't no need for searching
And for that, I say

[Chorus]
Thank you, next (ooh)
I'm so grateful for my-
Thank you, next (ooh)
I'm so grateful for my-
Thank you, next (ooh)
I'm so grateful for my-
Thank you, next (ooh)
I'm so grateful for-

[Outro]
Aah, aah, aah, aah

Watch out he’s coming for you
Watch him as he finds us on your roof
Well I came back home to find out I’d not had sex with you

Because now that you’re here
This song will go on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on and on
Because now that you’re here
This song will go on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on and on

We’ve wasted too much time again
So tell my friends that I just had an accident
Go on just tell my friends
That I just had to go

Because now that you’re here
This song will go on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on and on
Yes now that you’re here
This song will go

I can’t hear you
I can’t hear you
I can’t hear you
What did you say?

I can’t hear you
I can’t hear you
I can’t hear you
What did you say?

Fuck that
I’m sick of waiting on you
I dropped you off just as soon as I got my phone back
And I can’t hear you
I can’t hear you
I can’t hear you
Just what did you say?
(What did you say before?)

But but what
If he finds you but what
If he finds you but what
If he finds you but what
If he finds you but what
If he finds you but what
If he finds you but what
If he finds you but what
If he finds you but what
If he finds you but what
If he finds you but what
If he finds you but what
If he finds you but what
If he finds you but what
If he finds you but what
If he finds you but what
If he finds you but what
If he finds you but what
If he finds you?

This is a phone number to
You should have chose
You're making me and breaking me
I tried to be like you
And knocked down she wants you to
And I
When you fall asleep tonight
Because you dream of me

That's why I'm not asleep right now; I  can barely open my eyes
Now the telephone rang when you weren't getting any answer
You said you know she slept with him
Fuck the rain I'll walk back home

I can't find you
I can feel you're here
And now when you fall asleep you'll think tonight
You might just dream of me

That's why I'm not asleep right now; I  can barely open my eyes
Now the telephone rang when you weren't getting any answer
You said you know she slept with him
Fuck the rain I'll walk back home

That's why I'm not asleep right now; I  can barely open my eyes
Now the telephone rang when you weren't getting any answer
You said you know she slept with him
Fuck the rain I'll walk back home (x2)

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
I was about to say this. Good evening, The O2

London. London, we played here last night. Tonight, tonight was the first show that sold out

I loved last night. I loved it with all of my heart, it was one of the best parts of the night. But this is hard core

I want to feel as close as possible because this is fucking massive

Alright, let's just sing songs together

"A Change of Heart."

[Instrumental]

Are we awake?
Am I too old to be this stoned?
Was it your breasts from the start?
They played a part

For goodness sake
I wasn't told you'd be this cold
Now it's my time to depart
And I just had a change of heart

[Matthew Healy + audience]
I'll quote "on the road" like a twat
And wind my way out of the city
Finding a girl who is equally pretty won't be hard
Oh, I just had a change of heart

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
You got it. Let's go

[Instrumental interlude]

You smashed a glass into pieces
And that's around the time I left
And you were coming across as clever
Then you lit the wrong end of your cigarette

You said I'm full of diseases
Your eyes were full of regret
And then you took a picture of your salad
And put it on the Internet

And she said, "I've been so worried about you lately
You look shit and you smell a bit
You're mad thinking you could ever save me
Not looking like that"

[Matthew Healy + audience]
You used to have a face straight out of a magazine
Now you just look like anyone
I just had a change of heart

I feel as though I was deceived
I never found love in the city
I just sat in self-pity and cried in the car
Oh, I just had a change of heart

Then she said, "I've been so worried 'bout you lately
You were fit but you're losing it
You played a part, 'this is how it starts'"
Oh, I just had a change of heart

I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart

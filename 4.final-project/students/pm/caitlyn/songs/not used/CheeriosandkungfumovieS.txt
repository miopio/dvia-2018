(No matter how long it takes, Julien, I will stop you!)
(Courageous words, sire, but where you're going, that won't be possible.)

(No matter how long it takes, Julien, I will stop you!)

Now listen to me and put your head into my hands
I'm here to save the world because I'm a magic man


And I went through years of dreaming just to avoid you
But now you're back from outer space
With that sad look upon your face
Just like the one you had when you came back
And Laura told you we were going out
And I always said I mean you well
Watch out [?] one I swear
When I came back home to find the hotel rooms and the phone bills
You spent on him
[?] turn it around

Now here's the time of day
I've been around the block
[?] the guy who sits there smoking pot

And I went through years of dreaming just to avoid you
But now you're back from your grandma's place
With that pissed look upon your face
Just like the one you had when you came back
And found Bon Jovi had broken up
But I always said I mean you well
You're always living on a prayer
When I came back home to find the hotel rooms and the phone bills
You spent with him
You should have tried to turn it around

(You'll regret this, Julien. You'll regret this.)
(Careful, Roman. I'm sure there's more to this than meets the eye.)

And if I search, I'll find you

Darling

Well, I'm back
Can I see you?
I'm back
Can I see you?
I'm back
Can I see you?
I'm back
Can I see you?
I'm back
Can I see you?
I'm back
Can I see you?
I'm back
Can I see you?
I'm back
Can I see you?

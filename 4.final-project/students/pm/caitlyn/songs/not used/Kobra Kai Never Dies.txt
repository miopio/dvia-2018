[Verse 1]
You're quoting lyrics that I
Never thought you knew
He's coming round again
Cause now he don't give a fuck about you
And you'll work it out soon

[Verse 2]
You're throwing shapes at him
And everyone looks so uncool
Seen your face
When you found out
The songs were all about you
But he's the perfect gentleman to you

[Chorus]
It will all make sense
Yes, it will all make sense
It will all make sense
Yes, it will all make sense
It will all make sense
Yes, it will make sense later on

It's past 12 so I'm not getting up
It's past 12 so I'm not getting up
It's past 12 so I'm not getting up
It's past 12 so I'm not getting up
It's past 12 so I'm not getting up
It's past 12 so I'm not getting up

[Interlude]

[Refrain]
It's past 12 so I'm not getting up
Turns out that you don't give a fuck
And all of those books
Were all about you
Were all about you
Were all about you
Were all about you
It will all make sense
Yes, it will all make sense
Were all about you, you, you
It will all make sense
Yes, it will all make sense later on
Were all about you
It will all make sense
It will all make sense later on

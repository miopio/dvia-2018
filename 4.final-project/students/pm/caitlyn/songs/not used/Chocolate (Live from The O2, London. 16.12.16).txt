[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Call it a split cause you know that you will
You bite your friends like like chocolate
We go where nobody knows
Guns hidden under our petticoats
We're never gonna quit it
And we're never gonna quit it, no
Now we run, run away from the boys in the blue
And my car smells like chocolate
Hey now, think about what to do
I think about what to say, I think about how to think
Pause it, play it, London everyone!

[Chorus]
We go where nobody knows
With guns hidden under our petticoats
No, we're never gonna quit it
No, we're never gonna quit it, no
Yeah, we're dressed in black from head to toe
Guns hidden under our petticoats
No, we're never gonna quit it
No, we're never gonna quit it, no

[Post-Chorus: Matthew Healy + audience]
Now you're never gonna quit it
Now you're never gonna quit it
Now you're never gonna quit it
If you don't stop smoking it, why?
That's what she said
Dressed in black, head to toe
Guns hidden under our petticoats
No, we're never gonna quit it
No, we're never gonna quit it, no

[Verse 2]
We're building up speed as we're approaching the hill
OH, my hair smells like chocolate
Now, you say you're gonna quit it
But you're never gonna quit it
Go get it, go get it
Got get it, go get it, go!
And play it cool

[Chorus]
Oh, we go where nobody knows
With guns hidden under our petticoats
No, we're never gonna quit it
No, we're never gonna quit it, no
Yeah, we're dressed in black from head to toe
We've got guns hidden under our petticoats
No, we're never gonna quit it
No, we're never gonna quit it, no

[Bridge]
Well, I think we better go, seriously better go
Said the feds are here you know
Seriously better go
Well, I think we better go
Said the feds are here you know
Said Rebecca better know
Seriously better go

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
You still with us, London?

Let's go! One, two, three!

[Chorus]
Oh, we go where nobody knows
With guns hidden under our petticoats
No, we're never gonna quit it
No, we're never gonna quit it, no
Yeah, we're dressed in black from head to toe
Guns hidden under our petticoats
No, we're never gonna quit it
No, we're never gonna quit it, no

[Bridge]
Well, I think we better go, seriously better go
Said the feds are here you know
Seriously better go
Well, I think we better go
Said the feds are here you know
Said Rebecca better know
Seriously better go, hey!

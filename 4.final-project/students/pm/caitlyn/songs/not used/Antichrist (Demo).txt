[Verse 1]
I swear there's a ghost on this island
And his hands, all covered in blood
And my wife inquired of understanding
But of course, my dear, you can't

She said, "how can I relate to somebody who doesn't speak?
I feel like I'm just treading water"

[Chorus]
Is it the same for you?
Is it the same for you?

[Verse 2]
Well he comes and goes, so capricious
And his work appears so rushed
I love the house that we live in
And I love you all too much

[Chorus]
Is it the same for you?
Is it the same for you?
For you?

[Verse 3]
Criminals and liars
Keep them in your cell as a privilege of mine
And I love the house that we live in
And I love you all too much

You can't stand it, you can't stand it
You can't stand it, you can't stand it
You can't stand it, you can't stand it
You can't stand it, you can't stand it
You can't stand it, you can't stand it
You can't stand it, you can't stand it
You can't stand it, you can't stand it
You can't stand it, you can't stand it all
(You can't stand it, you can't stand it)
(You can't stand it, you can't stand it)
You can't stand it all
(You can't stand it, you can't stand it)
(You can't stand it, you can't stand it)
You can't stand it at all
(You can't stand it, you can't stand it)
(You can't stand it, you can't stand it)
You can't stand it at all
(You can't stand it, you can't stand it)
(You can't stand it, you can't stand it)

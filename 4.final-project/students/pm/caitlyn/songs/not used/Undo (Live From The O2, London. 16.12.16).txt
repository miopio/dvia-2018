[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
Yeah, yeah. Let's keep it going

It's thanks

[Verse 1]
Twist around the lounge
Sun drowns the house
Stick another pill in my head and go to bed
We're not doing it again so leave it

[Chorus]
(Ooh)I didn't even see you when I liked you
Now I ain't got no time
(And girl) Girl, I wanna see you undo it
I wanna see you but you're not mine

[Verse 2]
Bombs have run out
Call 'round the town
"I could hear you giving her head," she said
You think we're doing it again keep dreaming

[Chorus]
(Ooh) I didn't even see you when I liked you
Now I ain't got no time
(And girl [ohh]) Girl, I wanna see you undo it
I wanna see you but you're not mine

(Ooh) I didn't even see you when I liked you
Now I ain't got no time
(And girl [ohh]) Girl, I wanna see you undo it
I wanna see you but you're not mine

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
(Ooh) I didn't even see you when I liked you
Now I ain't got no time
(And girl) Girl, I wanna see you undo it
I wanna see you but you're not mine

(Ooh) I didn't even see you when I liked you
Now I ain't got no time
(And girl) Girl, I wanna see you undo it
I wanna see you but you're not mine

I wanna see you but you're not mine
I wanna see you but you're not mine
I wanna see you but you're not mine
I wanna see you but you're not mine
I wanna see you but you're not mine
I wanna see you but you're not mine
I wanna see you but you're not mine
I wanna see you but you're not mine
I wanna see you but you're not mine
I wanna see you but you're not mine
I wanna see you but you're not mine
I wanna see you but you're not mine

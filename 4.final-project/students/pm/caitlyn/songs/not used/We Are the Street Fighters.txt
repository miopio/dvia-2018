Hey, I watched your axe fall
Right through the bedroom floor
And I’m still five hits behind you
Your ninjas are a joke
Said I’ll collect up all them golden ropes
They’ll only slow you down
Or bring you close

And hey I’ll never watch Karate Kid without you
And hey I’ll never say the Golden Axe was a joke

Now I watched your axe fall
I can’t stand it when you’re so routine
(Now you’re so routine)
Hulk Hogan is the man
You know he kicked that Undertaker’s head

And hey I’ll never watch Karate Kid without you
And hey I’ll never say that Golden Axe was down

Well in four thousand miles we’ll meet you
Four thousand miles you’re left behind
And I’m so sorry that you couldn’t be

Well hold back your heartfelt stories
Your grandmothers lost her glory now
And I’m so sorry you had to be…

Yeah well the hotel’s got a ground floor
But your mother’s in the basement
And your dad just left he was crying on the steps like we’re all just trying to replace him well fuck you
And I’m so sorry that you’ll be

And hey I’ll never watch Karate Kid without you
And hey I’ll never say that Golden Axe was down

Well in four thousand miles, we’ll meet you
Four thousand miles you’re left behind
And I’m so sorry that you couldn’t be

Well hold back your heartfelt stories
Your grandmothers lost her glory now
And I’m so sorry that you’ll be

And hey now the hotel’s got a ground floor
But your mother’s in the basement
And your dad just left
He was crying on the steps
Like we’re all just trying to replace him
Well fuck you
And I’m so sorry that you’ll be

Well I will look and I will find
Yeah I will look and I will find
Yeah I will look and I will find
Yeah I will look and hey I will

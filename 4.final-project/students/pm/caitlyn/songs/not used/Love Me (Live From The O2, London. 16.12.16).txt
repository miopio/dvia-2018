[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
Please welcome my favourite band, The 1975!

[Verse 1]
Hey! Would you like to look outside sometimes? (No!)
I'm just with my friends online
And there's things we'd like to change!
(OH! Yeah)
Next thing you'll find you're reading about yourself on a plane, fame, what a shame!
OH! Well, just keep looking, looking, looking, looking!

[Chorus]
And love me (Yeah)
If that's what you want to do, oh (Yeah? No.)
And love me [fancy me] (Yeah)
If that's what you want to do (Oh. Yeah? No.)

[Verse 2]
You've been reading 'bout yourself on a plane, fame for a change
Caught up in fashion, Karcrashian panache
And a bag of bash for passion
You got a beautiful face but got nothing to say, oh!
Yeah, I'm telling ya, I think about that.....
"You look famous, let's be friends
And portray we possess something important
And do the things we'd like"
"We've just come to represent
A decline in the standards of what we accept!"
Yeah... Yeah... Yeah?! No!

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
How are you fucking feeling London!

[Chrous]
I said love me (Yeah, oh yeah)
If that's what you want to do (Oh. Yeah? No.)
Love me (love me, yeah)
If that's what you wanna do (Oh. Yeah? No.)

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
Thank you.... one...

[Interlude]

[Bridge]
Oh so sack off your calendar, give it to the people!
Be the man that gets them up on their feet
"Oh, oh, oh, oh, OHH!"

[Chorus]
I said love me, yeah
Shut up, oh yeah! (Oh)
I said love me, love me (Yeah)
If that's what you wanna do, oh (Yeah?)
One, two, three, four!

[Instrumental]

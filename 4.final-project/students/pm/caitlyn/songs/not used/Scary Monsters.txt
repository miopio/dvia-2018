I took the boat down to the blacksmith's at the breaks
Quite ridiculous (Quite ridiculous)
He said "The problem that we've got living round here's fighting all these scary monsters"
And there's one coming down
Top of the roofs
Get out the car
We're just running
Running away

It's in your house now
It's in your house now now
In your house now now

Well mister, you came straight bolting in looking scared
Quite ridiculous
Said "you never guess what just happened seven just got manipulus"

She said "you don't look frightened at all"
With one so near
You just kept on saying that it's all, it's all gonna get colder
It's gonna get colder now
Now you're here
You can make no sound
And they'll still sense you're near

They can't run as fast as I can
We'll be here soon
You'll be laughing, man

[Verse 1]
And be my mistake
Then turn out the light
She bought me those jeans
The ones you like
I don't want to hug
I just want to sleep
The smell of your hair
Reminds me of her feet

[Pre Chorus]
So, don't wait outside my hotel room
Just wait till I give you a sign
'Cause I get lonesome sometimes

[Chorus]
Save all the jokes you're going to make
Whilst I see how much drink I can take
Then be my mistake

[Verse 2]
I shouldn't have called
'Cause we shouldn't speak
You do make me hard
But she makes me weak

[Pre Chorus]
And don't wait outside my hotel room
Just wait till I give you a sign
'Cause I get lonesome sometimes

[Chorus]
And save all the jokes you're going to make
Whilst I see how much drink I can take
Then be my mistake

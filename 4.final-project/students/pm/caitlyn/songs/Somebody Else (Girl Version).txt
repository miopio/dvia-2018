[Verse 1]
So you said, you've found somebody else
And I prayed, that that was just a lie
So I said I loved you one more time
In case that would change your mind

[Chorus]
You said "I don't want your body but I know that you can find yourself somebody else
Our love has gone cold and it doesn't feel like home when I hold you close
And I'm lookin' at you tryna figure out if this is what you really want"
You said "I don't want your body but I know that you can find yourself somebody else"
I guess I don't want your body if you're wishing you were lying here with someone else

[Verse 2]
So you said, you've found, somebody else
And I hoped, that this, wasn't goodbye
But I can't help but wonder what went wrong
To make "forever" dead and gone

[Chorus 2]
You said "I don't want your body but I know that you can find yourself somebody else
Our love has gone cold and it doesn't feel like home when I hold you close
And I'm lookin' at you tryna figure out if this is what you really want"
You said "I don't want your body but I know that you can find yourself somebody else"
You said "I don't want your body but I know that you can find yourself somebody else"
I guess I don't want your body if you're wishing you were lying here with someone else

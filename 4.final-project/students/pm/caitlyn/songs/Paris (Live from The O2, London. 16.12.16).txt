[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
Let's do "Paris"!

[Verse 1]
She said 'hello', she was letting me know
We share friends in Soho
She's a pain in the nose
And I'm a pain in women's clothes
"And you're a walking overdose in a great coat"

And so she wrote a plan for it on the back of a fag packet
She had to leave because she couldn't hack it
Not enough noise and too much racket
"I think I've spent all my money and your friends"

[Chorus]
Oh-ohh, how I'd love to go to Paris again
How I'd love to go to Paris again

[Verse 2]
Mr. Serotonin Man, lend me a gram
You call yourself a friend?
I got two left feet and I'm starting to cheat
On my girlfriend again
I caught her picking her nose
As the crowd cheered for an overdose
And I don't suppose you know where this train goes
There was a party that she had to miss
Because her friend kept cutting her wrists
Hyperpoliticized sexual trysts
"Oh, I think my boyfriend's a nihilist"
I said, "Hey kids, we're all just the same
What a shame"

[Chorus]
Ya know, how I'd love to go to Paris again
How I'd love to go to Paris again

[Verse 3]
"Oh stop being an arsehole and counting my eye rolls"
"They're like piss holes in the snow" - uh oh, uh oh
Keeping a tab on my health
Man, you putting me up on a shelf
"Well, I'll believe you're clean
But only by seeing your face for myself"

And then she pointed at the bag of her dreams
In a well posh magazine
I said "I'm done, babe. I'm out of the scene,"
But I was picking up from Bethnal Green
She said I've been romanticizing heroin

[Chorus: Matthew Healy + audience]
And oh, how I'd love to go to Paris again

[Spoken: Matthew Healy]
You sing it!

And how I'd love to go to Paris again
And how I'd love to go to Paris again

[Instrumental]

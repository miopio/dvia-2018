She mistakes my name
I see the light come around
Strange as it seems
I'm bursting at the seams
And oh, I've got a woman now

Her wallet photos don't turn me on
I feel her hand come around
And her stone-wash denim jeans are darker than they seem
And oh, I've got a woman now

She said, "My name is Eileen, boy that's all you need
Oh, and this one's on the house, I don't mind"

It all tastes the same
And boy there's something different about your mouth
And you try chasing dreams, man it's harder than it seems
And oh, I've got a woman now
And oh, I've got a woman now

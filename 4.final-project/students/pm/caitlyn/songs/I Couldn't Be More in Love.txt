[Verse 1]
At the best of times I'm lonely in my mind
But I can find something to show you
If you have got the time
Why would I rely on the things that I did right?
She said, "I gave you four years of my life"

[Chorus]
So, what about these feelings I've got?
We got it wrong and you said you'd had enough
What about these feelings I've got?
I couldn't be more in love

[Verse 2]
I could have been a great line
I could have been a sign
Or overstay my time
Say what's on your mind
Maybe I'll rely on all the things that made it right
Because I'd give you all the years of my life

[Chorus]
So, what about these feelings I've got?
We got it wrong and you said you'd had enough
But what about these feelings I've got?
I couldn't be more in love

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
And what about these feelings I've got?
We got it wrong and you said you'd had enough
But what about these feelings I've got?
I couldn't be more in love

[Verse 1]
And she lays down on her bedroom floor
The chemicals that make her love
Don't seem to be working anymore
She tries her best, but it hurts her chest
And even though her sun is gone
She'd like to love her child nevertheless

[Verse 2]
My hair is brown, she's scared to touch
And she just wants to feel something
And I don't think that's asking for too much
And when I go to sleep it's when she begins to weep

[Chorus]
She's appalled by not loving me at all
She wears a frown and dressing gown
When she lays down

[Verse 3]
We got a plane, oh to see my dad again
She prayed that we'd fall from the sky
Simply to alleviate the pain
Over the water, hmm
Over terrain
The engines all go bust, we turned to dust
And I've no reason to complain, yeah
And in the end, she chose cocaine
But it couldn't fix her brain

[Chorus]
She's appalled
Oh, she doesn't love me at all
She wears a frown and dressing gown
When she lays down

[Matty Healy]
That was it

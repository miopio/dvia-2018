Heavy is the head that wears the crown
And everything that's up must come back down
And no one ever wants to see you fall
Like a sad balloon pops and it shakes
Even broken hearts can desolate in time

Everything will be just fine
But I'll follow my design
When the dust clears you will find
Everything you've been looking for

Lucky is the man who rolls the dice
A fool is a winner who rolls it twice
And everybody wants to see you fall
When he crumbles like a building made of bones
And it takes more than bricks to build a home

Everything will be just fine
But I'll follow my design
When the dust clears you will find
Everything you've been looking for

Everything you've been looking for

Everything will be just fine
But I'll follow my design
When the dust clears you will find
Everything you've been looking for

Everything you've been looking for

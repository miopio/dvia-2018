Game face, getting why so serious, child
You're like a boy delirious
When you say "Is this town worth living in, living in
Is this town worth living in?"

'Cause all the girls and boys in the city, well
Just care about things like how does my hair look? (Very good, very good)
Saying "How does my hair look?" (Very good)
Because we’re oh so scared of you
We’re oh so scared of you
We’re oh so scared of you

Do you remember when we spotted him, all suited and booted
She said "You’re living in a cellophane house, you're never leaving
You're living in a cellophane house, you're never leaving."

She said "Use your fangs in my spare time"
Come on in the car, you'll have a great time
You say "Is this town worth living in, living in
Is this town worth living in?"

Because we’re oh so scared of you
We’re oh so scared of you
We’re oh so scared of you

Because you’re living in a cellophane house, you're never leaving
Living in a cellophane house, you're never leaving
Well you’re, you’re in a cellophane house, you're never leaving
Living in a cellophane house, you're never leaving

We’re oh so scared of you
Oh so scared of you
We’re oh so scared of you
Oh so scared of you
We’re oh so scared of you
We’re oh so scared of you
We’re oh so scared of you, scared
We're oh so

Because you’re living in a cellophane house, you're never leaving
Living in a cellophane house, you're never leaving
Well you’re, you’re in a cellophane house, you're never leaving
Living in a cellophane house, you're never leaving

[Verse 1]
Twist around the lounge
Sun drowns the house
Stick another pill in my head and go to bed
We're not doing it again so leave it

[Chorus]
I didn't even see you when I liked you
Now I ain't got no time
Girl, I wanna see you undo it
I wanna see you but you're not mine

[Verse 2]
Bombs have run out
Call 'round the town
"I could hear you giving her head," she said
You think we're doing it again? Keep dreaming

[Chorus]
I didn't even see you when I liked you
Now I ain't got no time
Girl, I wanna see you undo it
I wanna see you but you're not mine

I didn't even see you when I liked you
Now I ain't got no time
Girl, I wanna see you undo it
I wanna see you but you're not mine

I didn't even see you when I liked you
Now I ain't got no time
Girl, I wanna see you undo it
I wanna see you but you're not mine

I didn't even see you when I liked you
Now I ain't got no time
Girl, I wanna see you undo it
I wanna see you but you're not mine

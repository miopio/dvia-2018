[Verse 1]
With a face from a movie scene
Or magazine, you know what I mean
She's definitely got the style on you
She's definitely got the style on you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
She's got two-tone everything
Moving but she just can't move
She's got two phones, everything
Moving but she just can't move

[Chorus]
Because she way out
I've never seen her dance moves
Dancing like she way out
She way out, I've never seen her talk
But I'm telling you she way out

[Verse 2]
She said "It's not about your body
It's just social implications are brought upon by this party that we're sitting in
And I'd like to say you've changed but you're always the same
I've got a feeling that the marijuana's rotting your brain"

[Pre-Chorus 2]
She's got two-tone everything, way too intelligent
Moving but she just can't move
She's got two phones, everything
Boyfriend, telling him, "Find me cause I'll never find you"

[Chorus]
Because she way out
I've never seen her dance moves
Dancing like she way out
She way out, I've never seen her talk
But I'm telling you she way out
Because she way out
I've never seen her dance moves
Dancing like she way out
She way out, I've never seen her talk
But I'm telling you she way out


[Bridge]
The tension is overflowing with every Benson she's throwing
On the floor and my mouth
She said "I'd love you to stay but that's simply insane
I've got a feeling that my friends are gonna kick in your brain"
Because

[Chorus]
Because she way out
I've never seen her dance moves
Dancing like she way out
She way out, I've never seen her talk
But I'm telling you she way out
Because she way out
I've never seen her dance moves
Dancing like she way out
She way out, I've never seen her talk
But I'm telling you she way out

She way out
She way out
She way out
She way out
She way out
I've never seen her dance moves
Dancing like she way out
She way out, I've never seen her talk
But I'm telling you she way out
She way out

[Verse 1]
A soft sound to the way she wears her hair down
Covering up her face
And oh, what a let down, I don't seem to be having any effect now
Falling all over the place

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And you're losing your words
We're speaking in bodies
Avoiding me and talking about you
And you're losing your turn
I guess I'll never learn
Cause I stay another hour or two

[Chorus]
For crying out loud, settle down!
You know I can't be found with you
We get back to my house
Your hands, my mouth
Now I just stop myself around you

[Verse 2]
A small town dictating all the people we get around
What a familiar face
Do you get what I mean now?
I'm so fixated on the girl with the soft sound
And hair all over the place

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You're sure that I'd learn
I'm pushing through bodies
Avoiding me and walking around you
You're cold and I burn
I guess I'll never learn
Cause I stay another hour or two

[Chorus]
For crying out loud, settle down!
You know I can't be found with you
We get back to my house
Your hands, my mouth
Now I just stop myself around you
(Hey!)

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 1]
A soft sound into the way she wears her hair down
Covering up her face
And oh, what a let down
I don't seem to be having any effect now
Falling all over the place

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And you're losing your words
We're speaking in bodies
Avoiding me and talking about you
And you're losing your turn
I guess I'll never learn
Cause I stay another hour or two

[Chorus]
For crying out loud, settle down!
You know I can't be found with you
We get back to my house
Your hands, my mouth
Now I just stop myself around you
(For crying out loud!)

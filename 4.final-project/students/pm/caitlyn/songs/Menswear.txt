[Instrumental]

"Well I only brought 3, what you lookin' at me for?"
She's dressed in white and putting off crying
"Well you're the best man, so what's the plan?
Why don't you talk to Matty about it?"
I said, "I only brought 3 like I told you before
We're gonna have to ask about."

Free bar, that's the point
Spilling Amaretto cause of previous joints
I'm sitting with a girl, fortunate placing
Preceding railing racket off a porcelain basin
Who's he? Giving you the lips?
I've never seen him knockin' about
He looks just like me, but 6 foot 3
So I reckon you could knock him out

"Well, I think I'll say a couple of words if you don't mind...
I never really got on with your bird the first time I met her out
Dressed in nowt, telling everybody you were shagging about"
Well, who's this? Going for the kiss
I'm probably gonna yosh in your mouth
Because it's 5 past 3, I can hardly see and I'm on the verge of passing out

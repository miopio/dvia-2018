[Verse 1]
Don't call it a fight when you know it's a war
With nothing but your t-shirt on
And go sit on the bed because I know that you want to
You've got pretty eyes, but I know you're wrong

[Verse 2]
And don't call it a spade if it isn't a spade
And go lie on the floor if you want
The first bit of advice that you gave me that I liked was they're too strong, too strong
Get in the shower if it all goes wrong

[Chorus]
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is, city is
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is

[Verse 3]
Yeah, counting cards was the best job he ever had
Cleaning up
He got good with his 4's and his 2's
Community service was the best job he ever had
Cleaning up
He got sick on the floor and his shoes

[Bridge]
Oh, and she said, "It's your birthday, are you feeling alright?"
The next one's the MD
You'll be feeling just fine
Your brother is just sat there
And you said that you felt snide
You hope that that boy will be alright

[Chorus]
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is, city is
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is

[Bridge]
Oh, and she said, "It's your birthday, are you feeling alright?"
The next one's the MD
You'll be feeling just fine
Your brother is just sat there
And you said that you felt snide
You hope that that boy will be alright

[Chorus]
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is, city is
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is

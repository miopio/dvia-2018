[Verse 1]
Hey! Would you like to look outside sometimes? (No!)
I'm just with my friends online
And there's things we'd like to change!
(OH! Yeah)
Next thing you'll find you're reading about yourself on a plane, fame! What a shame! (Oh!)
Well, just keep looking, looking, looking, looking!

[Chorus]
And love me (Yeah)
If that's what you wanna do, oh (Yeah? No.)
And love me (Yeah)
If that's what you wanna do, oh (Yeah? No)

[Verse 2]
You've been reading 'bout yourself on a plane, fame for a change
Caught up in fashion, Karcrashian panache
And a bag of bash for passion
You got a beautiful face but got nothing to say (OH!)
"You look famous, let's be friends
And portray we possess something important
And do the things we'd like"
"We've just come to represent
A decline in the standards of what we accept!"
Yeah... Yeah... Yeah?! No!

[Chorus]
And love me (Yeah, oh)
If that's what you wanna do, oh (Yeah? No)
And love me (Love me, yeah)
If that's what you wanna do, oh (Yeah? No)

[Interlude]

[Bridge]
Oh so sack off your calendar, give it to the people!
Be the man that gets them up on their feet
Say "Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhh"

[Chorus]
And love me (Yeah)
Oh (Yeah? No.)
And love me (Yeah)
If that's what you wanna do (Oh, yeah)

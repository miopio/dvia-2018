[Verse 1]
Hey, boy, stop pacing 'round the room
Using other people's faces as a mirror for you
I know your lungs need filling
Since your gums have lost their feeling
But don't say that you're giving it up again
"Do you have a card?
My irregular heart beat is starting to correct itself"
It's just a simple diarrhetic that prevents the empathetic
From being just and giving it up

[Chorus]
And you're the only thing that's going on in my mind
Taking over my life a second time
I don't have the capacity for fucking
You're meant to be helping me
When I said I liked it better without my money, I lied
It took a little while to recognize that I, I'm not giving it up again

[Verse 2]
This conversation's not about reciprocation no more
But I'm gon' wait until you finish so I can talk some more
About me and my things, my car, my living
And how I'm giving it up, giving it up again

[Chorus]
And you're the only thing that's going on in my mind
Taking over my life a second time
I don't have the capacity for fucking
You're meant to be helping me
When I said I liked it better without my money, I lied
It took a little while to recognize that I, I'm not giving it up again

[Bridge]
Oh, the kick won't last for long but the song only lasts 3 minutes
I think I've lost my phone so won't you call it up for me?
Oh the kick won't last for long but the song only lasts 3 minutes
And I know it's wrong but give me one

[Chorus]
And you're the only thing that's going on in my mind
Taking over my life a second time
I don't have the capacity for fucking
You're meant to be helping me
When I said I liked it better without my money, I lied
It took a little while to recognize that I, I'm not giving it up again

[Outro]
I'm not giving it up, I'm not giving it up
I'm not giving it up, I'm not giving it up
I'm not giving it up, giving it up
I'm not giving it up, giving it up!

[Intro]
(You got me like)
(You got me like)

[Verse 1: No Rome]
Take a picture of all my flaws
Or you can take a video on your phone
(You got me like)
And you know that I would talk
But I'm too afraid to pick you up and go home
(You got me like)
I'm feeling Dazed like a magazine
Finding my own sanity, wishing it'll all go away
(You got me like)
Now we're smoking off the balcony
You're telling me profanities, maybe it was never okay
(You got me like)

[Pre-Chorus: No Rome]
345, that's where we stayed
She told me I'm a narcissist doing it again
Took a bunch of acid and she told me, "not again"
Now I've gotta tell her that I'm lovin' her friends
345, that's where we stayed
She told me I'm a narcissist doing it again
Took a bunch of acid and she told me, "not again"
Now I've gotta tell her that I'm lovin' her friends

[Chorus: Matty Healy]
(You got me like) (You got me like)
(You got me like) (You got me like)
And I've been seeing somebody
But I've not found a way to tell you
(You got me like)
That I'm seeing somebody
There's not a nice way for me to say that
(You got me like)
I've been seeing somebody
You know I want you to be happy
(You got me like)
Since I'm seeing somebody and then maybe we can get on with it
(You got me like) (You got me like)
(You got me like)

[Verse 2: No Rome]
Stay out late, I just wanna get stoned
Telling all your friends that I'm never at home
And my face filling up with blood
But you're still saying they don't like your bourgeois
Coughing up the promethazine
Living like an evergreen, sorry for the things that I've done
Now Selena won't be friends with me, I was kissing Emily
I love you, it was never your fault (Got me like)

[Pre-Chorus: No Rome]
345, that's where we stayed
She told me I'm a narcissist doing it again
(You got me like)
Took a bunch of acid and she told me, "not again"
Now I've gotta tell her that I'm lovin' her friends

[Chorus: Matty Healy]
(You got me like)
And I've been seeing somebody
But I've not found a way to tell you
(You got me like)
That I'm seeing somebody
There's not a nice way for me to say that
(You got me like)
I've been seeing somebody
You know I want you to be happy
(You got me like)
Since I'm seeing somebody and then maybe we can get on with it
(You got me like) (You got me like)
(You got me like)
Seeing somebody (You got me like)

[Outro: No Rome]
345, that's where we stayed
She told me I'm a narcissist doing it again
Took a bunch of acid and she told me, "not again"
Now I'm boutta tell her that I'm lovin' her friends

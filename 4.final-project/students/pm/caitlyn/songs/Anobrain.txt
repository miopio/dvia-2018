In jeans so new
"We should eat one before 2"
Man I'm so high
I think I love you

And I was thinking about leaving again
It all depends, are we just friends?
And can you leave a little bit of your K?
For you, babe it's anobrain

We take your mum's car to the edge of the town
And we drive, yeah we go 'round and 'round

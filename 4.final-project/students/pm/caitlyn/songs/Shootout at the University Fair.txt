[Hook]
And you said "I am now in love"
If it's only for a while
But you're jealous and now in love
So just sit the fuck down and smile

[Verse 1]
And hey stop pushing me
I'm only here 'cos I wanna be
Your tight pants are way too scene

And now I'm through with talking to Jesus
'Cos he was a prick when I met him in Teasers
Now this is love without sleep

[Pre-Hook]
But watch out or you'll crash
And you'll go tumbling down like Jack or Jill
And cease to come back again

[Hook]
You said "I am now in love"
If it's only for a while
But you're jealous and now look
So just sit the fuck down and smile

[Verse 2]
Hey, this is for me
Exactly what you wanna be and I'm
So sorry you had to be

As soon as your brother got to the door
He was jumping off the roof like he does parkour, he broke his leg
I pissed myself and did one

[Pre-Hook]
Watch out or you'll crash
And you'll go tumbling down like Jack or Jill
And cease to come back again

[Hook]
You said "I am now in love"
She's only here for a while
But you're jealous and now in love
So just sit the fuck down and smile

[Bridge]
But what are you listening to?
But why are you listening to?
I guess you'll go with that

[Hook]
And you said "I am now in love"
If it's only for
You turn in the rain
You turn in the rain
You turn in rain
You don't need me
You don't need me

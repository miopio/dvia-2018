[Verse 1: Bure & (Ona)]
'Cause I'm going in my feelings, that's right
And all I need is some chocolate to save my life
Rest in peace 'Pac, I know in death you're still alive
For I like it when you sleep, The 1975
I got your girl on my hip, when I skrt in the whip
(C'mon boy get a grip)
Sorry guys that was Ona
He just going through drama
He just wanna be the best and he put that on him mama
Although Bure crashin' on these hittas like thunder
Yeah this dude's really good like the Boy Wonder
These hittas tearin' at me, I don't wanna be torn asunder
Please give me my hat 'cause I'm 'bout to wander over yonder
Hittas know I'm givin' the antidote like T Scott
Boy you better know, who better know, who make the scene pop
They can't stop me, I'm going hard non-stop
You better not cry, every waterfall's a teardrop
'Cause I'm gonna be acquitted for the crimes that I've committed
Step to me, I just forbid it
Don't permit it, don't forgive it
'Cause we never gonna quit it
That's my life, I'm gonna live it
That's my cap, it lookin' fitted
And my flow just counterfeited
I've been dealing with the pressure
Chillin' with the freshers
Drive just like a thresher
I just want this shit forever
In My Feeling's my endevour
Whenever ever I'm never gonna sever, yea

[Chorus: The 1975 & (Bure)]
Oh we go where nobody knows
With guns hidden under our petticoats
No we're never gonna quit it
No we're never gonna quit it, no
Yeah we're dressed in black from head to toe
We've got guns hidden under our petticoats
No we're never gonna quit it (In My Feelings x7)
No we're never gonna quit it, no

[Verse 2: Bure]
In My Feelings, we goin' in
Playin' the violin
Strummin' my mandolin
It's myself that I underpin
A backseat on this one
Strong enough to diss one
Holy like I'm Christian
Drummond like a Piston
Boy I'm tryna shine
Music is the only grind
Tryna find a piece of mind
Givin' up on humankind
Aight, I ain't goin' that far
But the way that you react to that just seems to bizarre
Ambitious, suspicious, malicious and even vicious
Saying "Word up!" to Zeke because I am superflicious
Please stay out of my business
'Cause my rhymes is the quickest
Yeah my rhymes is the slickest
Yeah my rhymes is the thickest
Goin' in my feelings, I ain't comin' out
I'm just here tryna find a different route
Yung Bure, boy you know what that's about
Man this ain't just something I can edit out

[Chorus: The 1975]
Oh we go where nobody knows
With guns hidden under our petticoats
No we're never gonna quit it
No we're never gonna quit it, no
Yeah we're dressed in black from head to toe
We've got guns hidden under our petticoats
No we're never gonna quit it
No we're never gonna quit it, no

[Bridge]
I'm just here to admit it
I ain't never gonna quit it
Look at the rhymes, how I spit it
Everybody get jiggy wit it
It's Bure and Matt Healey
Imma say this freely
Ideally
This ting just got me in my feelies

[Chorus: The 1975]
Oh we go where nobody knows
With guns hidden under our petticoats
No we're never gonna quit it
No we're never gonna quit it, no
Yeah we're dressed in black from head to toe
We've got guns hidden under our petticoats
No we're never gonna quit it
No we're never gonna quit it, no

[Bridge: The 1975]
Well I think we better go, seriously better go
Said the feds are here you know
Seriously better go
Oh oh, well I think we better go
Said the feds are here you know
Said Rebecca better know
Seriously better go

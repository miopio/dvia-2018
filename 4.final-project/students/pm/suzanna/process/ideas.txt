6.  Section titles - Machine Learning - How are the section titles different across states?

7.  Date created political party in power - Is there any connection between created laws and the political parties involved?

8.  Length of time to ratify law - How long did it take to ratify the laws across the USA?

9.  Health and Human Services (HHS) Wall of Shame dates to law creation/revisions - Are there any data breach statistics which relate to the laws?
